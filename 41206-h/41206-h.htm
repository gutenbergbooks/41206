<h1>BATTING TO WIN</h1>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3>A STRANGE MESSAGE</h3>


<p>Sid Henderson arose from the depths of an
antiquated easy chair, not without some effort,
for the operation caused the piece of furniture
to creak and groan, while from the thick cushions
a cloud of dust arose, making a sort of haze
about the student lamp, and forcing two other
occupants of the college room to sneeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Sid!&rdquo; expostulated Tom Parsons,
&ldquo;give a fellow notice, will you, when you&rsquo;re going
to liberate a colony of sneeze germs. I&mdash;er&mdash;ah!
kerchoo! Hoo! Boo!&rdquo; and he made a dive for
his pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Phil Clinton, as he coughed protestingly.
&ldquo;What do you want to get up for and
disturb everything, when Tom and I were so
nice and quiet? Why can&rsquo;t you sit still and enjoy
a good think once in a while? Besides, do you
want to give that chair spinal meningitis or lumbago?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Our old armchair, that has stuck to us,
through thick and thin, for better and for
worse&mdash;mostly worse, I guess. I say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came near sticking to it, myself,&rdquo; remarked
Sidney Henderson, otherwise known as, and
called, Sid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like getting out of the middle
of a featherbed to leave it. And say, it does
act as if it was going to pieces every time one
gets in or out of it,&rdquo; he added, making a critical
inspection of the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you want to get in or out?&rdquo;
asked Phil, closing a book, over which he had
made a pretense of studying. &ldquo;Why do you do
it, I ask? You may consider that I have moved
the previous question, and answer,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;How about it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman is out of order,&rdquo; decided Tom,
a tall, good-looking lad, with the bronzed skin of
an athlete, summer and fall, barely dimmed by
the enforced idleness of winter. &ldquo;Sid, you are
most decidedly out of order&mdash;I think I&rsquo;m going
to sneeze again,&rdquo; and he held up a protesting
hand. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not, either,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;False alarm. My, what a lot of dust! But,
go ahead, Sid, answer the gentleman&rsquo;s query.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentleman?&rdquo; repeated the lad, who had arisen
from the easy chair, and there was a questioning
note in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Here! Save that for the amateur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
theatricals!&rdquo; cautioned Tom, looking about for
something to throw at his chum. &ldquo;Why did you
get up? Answer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see if it had stopped raining,&rdquo;
announced Sid, as he moved over toward one of
the two windows in the rather small living room
and study, occupied by the three chums, who were
completing their sophomore year at Randall College.
&ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s slacking up some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slacking up some!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped raining!&rdquo; echoed Phil. &ldquo;Listen to
it! Cats and dogs, to say nothing of little puppies,
aren&rsquo;t in it. It&rsquo;s a regular deluge. Listen
to it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held up his hand. Above the fussy ticking
of a small alarm clock, which seemed to contain a
six-cylindered voice in a one-cylindered body, and
which timepiece was resting at a dangerous angle
on a pile of books, there sounded the patter of
rain on the windows and the tin gutter outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rain, rain, nothing but rain!&rdquo; grumbled Phil.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had a decent day for baseball practice
in two weeks. I&rsquo;m sick of the inside cage,
and the smell of tan bark. I want to get into
the open, with the green grass of the outfield to
fall on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this weather is good for making the
grass grow,&rdquo; observed Tom, as he got up from
his chair, and joined Sid at the window, down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
which rain drops were chasing each other as if in
glee at the anguish of mind they were causing the
three youths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you anxious to begin twirling the horsehide?&rdquo;
asked Sid. &ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d lose
some speed, having only the cage to practice in,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, but I guess we&rsquo;ll get some decent
weather soon. This can&rsquo;t last forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a fair way to,&rdquo; grumbled Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a nice night if it didn&rsquo;t rain,&rdquo;
came from Sid musingly, as he turned back to
the old easy chair, &ldquo;which remark,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;is one a little boy made in the midst of a driving
storm, when he met his Sunday-school teacher,
and wanted to say something, but didn&rsquo;t know
what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your apology is accepted,&rdquo; murmured Tom.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you fellows are going to do,
but I&rsquo;m going to sew up a rip in my pitcher&rsquo;s
glove. I think maybe if I do the weather man
will get a hunch on himself, and hand us out a
sample of a nice day for us to select from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice nothing!&rdquo; was what Phil growled, but
with the activity of Tom in getting out his glove,
and searching for needle and thread, there came
a change of atmosphere in the room. The rain
came down as insistently, and the wind lashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the drops against the panes, but there was an
air of relief among the chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to fix a rip in my own glove,&rdquo; murmured
Sid. &ldquo;Guess I might as well get at it,&rdquo;
and he noted Tom threading a needle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got to do a little more boning on
this trigonometry,&rdquo; added Phil, as, with a sigh,
he opened the despised book.</p>

<p>For a time there was silence in the apartment,
while the rain on the windows played a tattoo,
more or less gentle, as the wind whipped the
drops; the timepiece fussed away, as if reminding
its hearers that time and tide waited for no man,
and that 99-cent alarm clocks were especially exacting
in the matter. Occasionally Sid shifted his
position in the big chair, to which he had returned,
each movement bringing out a cloud of dust, and
protests from his chums.</p>

<p>The room was typical of the three lads who
occupied it. At the beginning of their friendship,
and their joint occupation of a study, they had
agreed that each was to be allowed one side of
the apartment to decorate as he saw fit. The
fourth side of this particular room was broken
by two windows, and not of much use, while one
of the other walls contained the door, and this
one Sid had chosen, for the simple reason that
his fancy did not run to such things as did Tom&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and Phil&rsquo;s, and he required less space for his
ornaments.</p>

<p>Sid was rather an odd character, somewhat
quiet, much given to study, and to delving after
the odd and unusual. One of his fads was biology,
and another, allied to it, nature study. He
would tramp all day for a sight of some comparatively
rare bird, nesting; or walk many miles to
get a picture of a fox, or a ground-hog, just as it
darted into its burrow. In consequence Sid&rsquo;s
taste did not run to gay flags and banners of the
college colors, worked by the fair hands of pretty
girls, nor did he care to collect the pictures of
the aforesaid girls, and stick them up on his wall.
He had one print which he prized, a representation
of a football scrimmage, and this occupied
the place of honor.</p>

<p>As for Tom and Phil, the more adornments
they had the better they liked it, though I must
do them the credit to say that they only had one
place of honor for one girl&rsquo;s photograph at a
time. But they sometimes changed girls. Then,
on their side, were more or less fancy pictures&mdash;scenes,
mottoes, and what not. Much of the
ornamentation had been given them by young lady
friends.</p>

<p>Of course the old chair and an older sofa, together
with the alarm clock, which had been
handed down from student to student until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mind of Randallites ran not to the contrary, were
the chief other things in the apartment, aside
from the occupants thereof. Each lad had a
desk, and a bureau or chiffonier, or &ldquo;Chauffeur&rdquo;
as Holly Cross used to dub them. These articles
of furniture were more or less in confusion.
Neckties, handkerchiefs, collars and cuffs were
piled in a seemingly inextricable, if not artistic,
confusion. Nor could much else be expected in
a room where three chums made a habit of indiscriminately
borrowing each other&rsquo;s articles of
wearing apparel, provided they came any where
near fitting.</p>

<p>On the floor was a much worn rug, which Phil
had bought at auction at an almost prohibitive
price, under the delusion that it was a rare Oriental.
Learning to the contrary he and his chums
had decided to keep it, since, old and dirty as it
was, they argued that it saved them the worriment
of cleaning their feet when they came in.</p>

<p>Then there were three neat, white, iron beds&mdash;neat
because they were made up fresh every day,
and there was a dormitory rule against having
them in disorder. Otherwise they would have suffered
the fate of the walls, the rug or the couch
and easy chair. Altogether it was a fairly typical
student apartment, and it was occupied, as I hope
my readers will believe, by three of the finest chaps
it has been my lot to write about; and it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
this room that my story opens, with the three lads
busily engaged in one way or another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say! Hang it all!&rdquo; burst out Sid finally.
&ldquo;How in the mischief do you shove a needle
through this leather, Tom? It won&rsquo;t seem to go,
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should use a thimble,&rdquo; observed Tom.
&ldquo;Nothing like &rsquo;em, son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thimble!&rdquo; cried Sid scornfully. &ldquo;Do you
take me for an old maid? Where did you ever
learn to use a thimble?&rdquo; and he walked over to
where Tom was making an exceedingly neat job
of mending his glove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I picked it up,&rdquo; responded the pitcher of
the Randall &rsquo;varsity nine. &ldquo;Comes in handy when
your foot goes through your socks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s what they do pretty frequently
these days,&rdquo; added Phil. &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t anything
to do, Tom, I wish you&rsquo;d get busy on some
of my footwear. I just got a batch back from
the laundry, and I&rsquo;m blessed if out of the ten
pairs of socks I can get one whole pair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look &rsquo;em over,&rdquo; promised the pitcher.
&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s as good as new; in fact better, for
it fits my hand,&rdquo; and he held up and gazed critically
at the mended glove. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s yours, Sid?&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mend it for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence was the atmosphere of the apartment
for a few minutes&mdash;that is comparative silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
though the pushing of Tom&rsquo;s needle through the
leather, squeaking as he forced it, mingled with
the ticking of the clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we can count on a good nine this
year,&rdquo; observed Tom judicially, apropos of the
glove repairing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, cap,&rdquo; remarked Sid, for Tom
had been elected to that coveted honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s up to you fellows,&rdquo; retorted
the pitcher-captain. &ldquo;I want some good batters,
that&rsquo;s what I want. It&rsquo;s all right enough to have
a team that can hold down Boxer Hall and Fairview
Institute, but you can&rsquo;t win games by shutting
out the other fellows. Runs are what count,
and to get runs you&rsquo;ve got to bat to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to the oracle!&rdquo; mocked Phil, but with
no malice in his voice. &ldquo;You want to do better
than three hundred with the stick, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Physician, heal thyself!&rdquo; quoted Tom, smiling.
&ldquo;I think we will have a good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the sound of footsteps
coming along the corridor. Instinctively the three
lads started, then, as a glance at the clock showed
that they were not burning lights beyond the prescribed
hour, there was a breath of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woodhouse, Bricktop or some of the royal
family,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; remarked Sid quietly, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that in his voice which made his chums look curiously
at him, for it seemed as if he expected some
one. A moment later there came a rap on the
door, and then, with a seeming knowledge of
the nerve-racking effect this always has on college
students, a voice added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Wallops, the messenger. I have a note
for Mr. Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; and there was a startled query in
Sid&rsquo;s voice, as he went to the door.</p>

<p>Outside the portal stood a diminutive figure&mdash;Wallops&mdash;the
college messenger, so christened in
ages gone by&mdash;perhaps because of the chastisements
inflicted on him. At any rate Wallops he
was, and Wallops he remained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A message for me?&rdquo; repeated Sid. &ldquo;Where
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Feller brought it, and said it was
for you,&rdquo; and, handing the youth an envelope, the
messenger departed.</p>

<p>Sid took out the note, and rapidly scanned it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See him blush!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Think of
it, Tom, Sid Henderson, the old anchorite, the
petrified misogynist, getting notes from a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sport
her photograph, old man?&rdquo; and he glanced at
several pictures of pretty girls that adorned the
sides of the room claimed by Phil and himself.</p>

<p>Sid did not answer. He read the note through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
again, and then began to tear it into bits. The
pieces he thrust into his pocket, but one fluttered,
unnoticed, to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go out, fellows,&rdquo; he announced in
a curiously quiet voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out&mdash;on a night like this?&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. Listen to the rain! It&rsquo;s pouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; was the answer, as the lad
began delving among his things for a raincoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; burst out Phil. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
wait until to-morrow to see her, old sport? My,
but you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em bad for a fellow who wouldn&rsquo;t
look at a girl all winter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a girl,&rdquo; and Sid&rsquo;s voice was still oddly
calm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;don&rsquo;t bother
me&mdash;you chaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was such a sudden snap to the last words&mdash;something
so different from Sid&rsquo;s usual gentle
manner&mdash;that Phil and Tom looked at each other
in surprise. Then, as if realizing what he had
said, Sid added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t talk about&mdash;just yet.
I&rsquo;ve got to go&mdash;I promised&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ll be
back soon&mdash;I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Proc. Zane?&rdquo; asked Tom, for the
proctor of Randall College was very strict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to chance it,&rdquo; replied Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
about two hours yet, before locking-up time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
if I get caught&mdash;well my reputation&rsquo;s pretty
good,&rdquo; and he laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>This was not the Sid that Tom and Phil&mdash;his
closest chums&mdash;had known for the last three
terms. It was a different Sid, and the note he
received, and had so quickly destroyed, seemed
to have worked the change in him. Slowly he
drew on his raincoat and took up an umbrella.
He paused a moment in the doorway. The rain
was coming down harder than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; said Sid, as he stepped into the corridor.
He almost collided with another youth
on the point of entering, and the newcomer exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows! I&rsquo;ve got great news! Baseball
news! I know this is a rotten night to talk diamond
conversation, but listen. There&rsquo;s been a
new trophy offered for the championship of the
Tonoka Lake League! Just heard of it. Dr.
Churchill told me. Some old geezer that did
some endowing for the college years ago, had a
spasm of virtue recently and is now taking an
interest in sports. It&rsquo;s a peach of a gold loving
cup, and say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Holly,&rdquo; invited Tom, &ldquo;Holly&rdquo;
being about all that Holman Cross was ever
called. &ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; went on Tom, &ldquo;and chew
it all over for us. Say, it&rsquo;s great! A gold loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cup! We must lick the pants off Boxer and Fairview
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holly started to enter the room, Phil and Tom
reaching out and clasping his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you bound for?&rdquo; asked Holly,
looking at Sid, attired in the raincoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go out,&rdquo; was the hesitating answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you hear the news,&rdquo; invited Holly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great! It will be the baseball sensation of
the year, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;sorry, but I&rsquo;ve got to go. I&rsquo;ll be
back&mdash;soon&mdash;I guess. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to go,&rdquo;
and breaking away from the detaining hand of
Holly, the strangely-acting boy turned down the
corridor, leaving his roommates, and the newcomer,
to stare curiously after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever has gotten into old Sid?&rdquo; inquired
Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search us,&rdquo; answered Phil. &ldquo;He got a note
a little while ago; seemed quite put out about it,
tore it up and then tore out, just as you saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A note, eh?&rdquo; mused Holly, as he threw himself
full length on a rickety old sofa, much
patched fore and aft with retaining boards&mdash;a
sofa that was a fit companion for the ancient
chair. It creaked and groaned under the substantial
bulk of Holly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo; cautioned Phil. &ldquo;Do you want to
wreck our most cherished possession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone who can wreck this would be a wonder,&rdquo;
retorted Holly, as he looked over the edge,
and saw the boards that had been nailed on to
repair a bad fracture. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed a
moment later, as he picked up from the floor a
scrap of paper. &ldquo;You fellows are getting most
uncommon untidy. First you know Proc. Zane
will have you up on the carpet. You should keep
your scraps of paper picked up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t put that there,&rdquo; declared Tom.
&ldquo;That must be part of the note Sid tore up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idly Holly turned the bit of paper over. It
was blank on one side, but, at the sight of the
reverse the athlete uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, fellows, look here!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He held the paper scrap out for their inspection.
It needed but a glance to see that it bore
but one word, though there were pen tracings of
parts of other words on the edges. But the word
that stood plainly out was &ldquo;<i>trouble</i>,&rdquo; and it appeared
to be the end of a sentence, for a period
followed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; mused Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; repeated Phil. &ldquo;I wonder if that
means Sid is going to get into trouble?&rdquo; and his
voice took a curious turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; added Tom, the last of the trio to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
use the word. &ldquo;Certainly something is up or Sid
wouldn&rsquo;t act the way he did. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any of our affair,&rdquo; spoke Holly softly,
&ldquo;that is unless Sid wants our help, of course. I
guess we shouldn&rsquo;t have looked at this. It&rsquo;s like
reading another chap&rsquo;s letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; decided Phil. &ldquo;Go
ahead, Holly. Tell us about the trophy. Sid
may be back soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, here goes,&rdquo; and wiggling into a
more comfortable position on the sofa, an operation
fraught with much anxiety on the part of
Phil and Tom, Holly launched into a description
of the loving cup. But, unconsciously perhaps, he
still held in his hand that scrap of paper&mdash;the
paper with that one word on&mdash;&ldquo;<i>trouble</i>.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>SID IS CAUGHT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; began Holly, as he crossed
one leg over, and clasped his hands under his
recumbent head. &ldquo;Randall has been looking up
in athletics lately. Since we did so well last season
on the diamond, and won the championship at
football, some of the old grads and men who
have such &lsquo;oodles&rsquo; of money that they don&rsquo;t know
what to do with it, have a kindlier feeling for the
old college. It&rsquo;s that which brought about the
presentation of the loving cup trophy, or, rather
the offer of it to the winner of the baseball championship
of the Tonoka Lake League. The cup
will be worth winning, so the doctor says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he come to tell you?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I happened to go to his study to consult him
about some of my studies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes you did!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom disbelievingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went there because Proc. Zane made
you!&rdquo; declared Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter, if you can&rsquo;t take a gentleman&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
word for it,&rdquo; said Holly, with an assumed
injured air. &ldquo;Anyhow, I was in the doctor&rsquo;s office,
and he had just received a letter from some old
grad, honorary degree man, offering the gold cup.
Doc asked me if I thought the boys would like to
play for it. Has to be won two out of three times
before any college can keep it. I told him we&rsquo;d
play for it with bells on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; agreed Tom and Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, about the team for this spring?&rdquo; resumed
Holly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re captain, Tom, but we&rsquo;ve got to
elect a manager soon, and we&rsquo;d better begin talking
about it,&rdquo; and then the trio launched into a
rapid-fire talk on baseball and matters of the
diamond.</p>

<p>The three youths were sophomores in Randall
College, a well-known institution located near the
town of Haddonfield, in one of our Middle Western
States. The college proper was on the shore
of Sunny River, not far from Lake Tonoka; and
within comparative short distance of Randall were
two other colleges. One was Boxer Hall, and
the other Fairview Institute&mdash;the latter a co-educational
institution. The three, together with
some other near-by colleges and schools, formed
what was called the Tonoka Lake Athletic
League, and there were championship games of
baseball, football, tennis, hockey, golf, and other
forms of sport.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Those of you who have read the previous volumes
of this &ldquo;College Sports Series&rdquo; need little
if any introduction to the characters who have
held the stage in my opening chapter. Others
may care for a formal introduction, which I am
happy to give them.</p>

<p>In the first book, called &ldquo;The Rival Pitchers,&rdquo;
there was told of the efforts Tom Parsons
made to gain the place as &ldquo;twirler&rdquo; on the &rsquo;varsity
nine. Tom was a farmer&rsquo;s son, in moderate
circumstances, and had come to Randall from
Northville. Almost at once he got into conflict
with Fred Langridge, a rich student, who was
manager of the &rsquo;varsity ball nine, and also its
pitcher, and who resented Tom&rsquo;s efforts to
&ldquo;make&rdquo; the nine. After much snubbing on the
part of Langridge, and not a few unpleasant
experiences Tom got his chance. Eventually he
supplanted Langridge, who would not train
properly, and who smoked, drank and gambled,
thinking himself a &ldquo;sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom soon became one of the most liked of
the sporting crowd, and the especial friend of
Phil Clinton and Sidney Henderson, with whom
he had roomed for the last term. The three
were now called the &ldquo;inseparables.&rdquo; In the first
book several thrilling games were told of, also
how Randall won the championship after a hard
struggle with Boxer and Fairview, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
games Tom Parsons fairly &ldquo;pitched his head
off,&rdquo; to quote Holly Cross, who was an expert
on diamond slang. Langridge did his best to
injure Tom, and nearly succeeded, but the
pitcher had many friends, besides his two special
chums, among them being Holly Cross, Bricktop
Molloy, Billy or &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; Housenlager, who was
full of horseplay, &ldquo;Snail&rdquo; Looper, so called from
his ability to move with exceeding slowness, and
his liking for night prowlings.</p>

<p>Then there was Pete Backus, known as
&ldquo;Grasshopper,&rdquo; from his desire, but inability, to
shine as a high and broad distance jumper;
&ldquo;Bean&rdquo; Perkins, a &ldquo;shouter&rdquo; much depended on
in games, when he led the cheering; Dan Woodhouse,
called Kindlings, and Jerry and Joe Jackson,
known as the &ldquo;Jersey Twins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, Tom and his two chums had many
other friends whom you will meet from time to
time. Sufficient to say that he &ldquo;made good&rdquo; in
the eyes of the coach, Mr. Leighton, and was
booked not only to pitch on the &rsquo;varsity again,
but he had been elected captain, just before the
present story opens.</p>

<p>Phil Clinton was the hero of my second volume,
a story of college football, entitled &ldquo;A
Quarter Back&rsquo;s Pluck.&rdquo; Phil was named for
quarter back on the &rsquo;varsity eleven, but, for a
time it looked as if he would be out of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
important games. His mother was very ill in
Florida, in danger of death from a delicate operation,
and Phil, and his sister Ruth Clinton (who
attended Fairview Institute) were under a great
nervous strain.</p>

<p>Langridge, seeing that Tom was beyond his
vengeance, tried his tricks on Phil. Together
with Garvey Gerhart, a freshman, Langridge
planned to keep Phil out of an important game.
They &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; a bottle of liniment he used, but
this trick failed. Then they planned to send him,
just before an important contest, a telegram, stating
that his mother was dying. They figured that
he would not play and that Randall would lose
the contest&mdash;both Gerhart and Langridge being
willing to thus play the traitor to be revenged on
the coach and captain of the eleven.</p>

<p>But, with characteristic pluck, Phil went into
the game, stuffing the fake telegram in his pocket,
and playing like a Trojan, even though he believed
his mother was dying. It was pluck personified.
After aiding his fellows to win the championship,
Phil hurried off the field, to go to Florida to his
mother. Then, for the first time, he learned that
the message he had received was a &ldquo;fake&rdquo;&mdash;for
his mother was on the road to recovery as stated
in a telegram his sister Ruth had received.</p>

<p>Of course the trick Langridge and Gerhart
played was found out, and they both left Randall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
quietly, so that the name of the college might not
be disgraced.</p>

<p>But though Tom, Phil, Sid and their chums
lived a strenuous life when sports were in the
ascendency, that does not mean that they had no
time for the lighter side of life. There were
girls at Fairview&mdash;pretty girls and many of them.
One, in particular&mdash;Madge Tyler&mdash;seemed to fit
Tom&rsquo;s fancy, and he and she grew to be very
friendly. Perhaps that was because Tom had
rather supplanted Langridge in the eyes of Miss
Tyler, who had been to many affairs with him,
before she knew his true character. Then there
was Ruth Clinton, Phil&rsquo;s sister. After meeting
her Tom was rather wavering in his attachment
toward Miss Tyler, but matters straightened
themselves out, for Phil and Miss Tyler seemed
to &ldquo;hit it off,&rdquo; to once more quote Holly Cross,
though for a time there was a little coldness between
Tom and Phil on this same girl question.
When this story opens, however, Tom considered
himself cheated if he did not see Ruth at least
twice a week, and as for Phil, he and Miss Tyler&mdash;but
there, I&rsquo;m not going to be needlessly cruel.</p>

<p>To complete the description of life at Randall
I might mention that Dr. Albertus Churchill,
sometimes called &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; was the venerable and
well-beloved head of the institution, and that as
much as he was revered so much was Mr. Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Zane, the proctor, disliked; for, be it
known, the proctor did not always take fair advantage
of the youths, and he was fond of having
them &ldquo;upon the carpet,&rdquo; or, in other words, before
Dr. Churchill for admonition about certain
infractions of the rules. Another character, little
liked, was Professor Emerson Tines, dubbed
&ldquo;pitchfork,&rdquo; by his enemies, and they were legion.</p>

<p>I believe that is all&mdash;no, to give you a complete
picture of life at Randall I must mention
that Sidney Henderson, the third member of the
&ldquo;inseparables&rdquo; was a woman hater&mdash;a misogynist&mdash;an
anchorite&mdash;a dub&mdash;almost anything
along that line that his chums could think to call
him. He abhorred young ladies&mdash;or he thought
he did&mdash;and he and Tom and Phil were continually
at variance on this question, and that of
having girls&rsquo; photographs in the common study.
But of that more later.</p>

<p>With Holly stretched out on the old sofa, and
Phil and Tom in various tangled attitudes in
chairs&mdash;Phil in the depths of the ancient one&mdash;the
talk of baseball progressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must have an election for manager
soon,&rdquo; conceded Tom. &ldquo;But first I want to see
what sort of a team I&rsquo;m going to have. We
need outdoor practice, but if this rotten weather
keeps up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! I think I hear the rain stopping,&rdquo; exclaimed
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop nothing,&rdquo; declared Holly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
catching its breath for another deluge.&rdquo; And it
did seem so, for, presently, there came a louder
patter than ever, of drops on the tin gutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, guess I&rsquo;d better be moving,&rdquo; announced
Holly, after another spasm of talk.
&ldquo;What time is it by your town clock, anyhow?&rdquo;
and he shied a book at the alarm timepiece so
that the face of it would be slewed around in
his direction, giving him a peep at it without
obliging him to get up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! What are you trying to do?&rdquo; demanded
Tom. &ldquo;Do you want to break the works,
and stop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Holly lazily.
&ldquo;Just turn it around for me, will you, like a
good fellow. I don&rsquo;t see how I missed it. I
must practice throwing, or I won&rsquo;t be any good
when the ball season opens. Give me another
shot?&rdquo; and he raised a second volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit!&rdquo; cried Tom, interposing his arm in
front of the fussy little clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That calls us to our morning duties,&rdquo; added
Phil, adding in a sing-song voice: &ldquo;Oh, vandal,
spare that clock, touch not a single hand, for
surely it doth keep the time the worst in all the
land.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fierce,&rdquo; announced Holly, closing his eyes
and pretending to breathe hard. &ldquo;It tells you
how much longer you can sleep in the morning,
I guess you mean,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The three of
you were late for chapel this a. m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Sid monkeyed with the regulator,&rdquo;
insisted Tom. &ldquo;He thought he could
improve it. But, say, it is getting late. Nearly
ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sid isn&rsquo;t back yet,&rdquo; went on Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My bedtime, anyhow,&rdquo; came from Holly, as
he slid from the sofa, and glided from the room.
&ldquo;So long. Sid wants to look out or he&rsquo;ll be
caught. Proc. Zane has a new book, and he
wants to get some of the sporting crowd down
in it. See you in the dewy morn, gents,&rdquo; and
he was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid <i>is</i> late,&rdquo; murmured Tom, as he began to
prepare for bed. &ldquo;Shall we leave a light for
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. Too risky,&rdquo; decided Phil. &ldquo;No use
of us all being hauled up. But maybe he&rsquo;s back,
and is in some of the rooms. He&rsquo;s got ten minutes
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the ten minutes passed, and ten more, and
Sid did not come back. Meanwhile Tom and
Phil had &ldquo;doused their glim,&rdquo; and were in bed,
but not asleep. Somehow there was an uneasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
feeling worrying them both. They could not
understand Sid&rsquo;s action in going off so suddenly,
and so mysteriously&mdash;especially as there was a
danger of being caught out after hours. And, as
Sid was working for honors, to be caught too
often meant the danger of losing that for which
he had worked so hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom, in a
low voice, when from the chapel clock, the hour
of eleven boomed out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>Some one was coming along the corridor&mdash;two
persons to judge by the footsteps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that Sid?&rdquo; whispered Tom.</p>

<p>Phil did not answer. A moment later the door
opened, and in the light that streamed from a
lamp in the corridor, Sid could be seen entering.
Behind him stood Proctor Zane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will report to Dr. Churchill directly after
chapel in the morning,&rdquo; the proctor said, in his
hard, cold voice. &ldquo;You were out an hour after
closing time, Mr. Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered Sid quietly, as he
closed the door, and listened to Mr. Zane walking
down the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught?&rdquo; asked Tom, though there was no
need of the query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Sid shortly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; asked Phil, sitting up in
bed, and trying to peer through the darkness
toward his unfortunate chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out,&rdquo; was the answer, which was none at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Tom. Then, suddenly:
&ldquo;You must have been hitting it up, Sid. I thought
you didn&rsquo;t smoke. Been trying it for the first
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been smoking!&rdquo; came the answer,
in evident surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your clothes smell as if you&rsquo;d been at the
smoker of the Gamma Sig fraternity,&rdquo; declared
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, and let a fellow alone; can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; burst out Sid, and he threw his shoes
savagely into the corner of the room. Neither
Tom nor Phil replied, but they were doing a
great deal of thinking. They could not fathom
Sid&rsquo;s manner&mdash;he had never acted that way before.
What could be the matter? It was some
time before they learned Sid&rsquo;s secret, and the
keeping of it involved Sid in no small difficulties,
and nearly cost the college the baseball championship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>MISS MABEL HARRISON</h3>


<p>Neither Tom nor Phil made any reference,
the following morning, to the incident of the
night before. As usual, none of the boys got
up when the warning of the alarm clock summoned
them, for they always allowed half an
hour for its persistent habit of running fast. As
it was, it happened to be correct on this occasion,
and they were barely in time for chapel,
Tom having to adjust his necktie on the race
across the campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s on for to-day?&rdquo; asked Phil, as,
with Tom and Sid, he strolled from the chapel
after service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baseball practice this afternoon,&rdquo; decided
Tom, for the rain had stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be pretty sloppy,&rdquo; observed Phil dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wear rubbers,&rdquo; advised the captain. &ldquo;The
fellows need some fresh air, and they&rsquo;re going
to get it. Be on hand, Sid?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Now I&rsquo;ve got to get a disagreeable
job over with. Me for the doctor&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; and
that was his only reference to the punishment
meted out to him. He was required to do the
usual number of lines of Latin prose, which was
not hard for him, as he was a good scholar.
Tom and Sid went to their lectures, the captain,
on the way, calling to the various members of
the team to be on hand at the diamond in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Sid accomplished his sentence of punishment
in the room, and after dinner the three chums,
with a motley crowd of players, and lovers of
the great game, moved over the campus toward
the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done anything about a manager?&rdquo; asked
Holly Cross, as he tightened his belt and began
tossing up a grass-stained ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s time
enough. I want to get the fellows in some kind
of shape. We won&rsquo;t play a game for a month
yet&mdash;that is any except practice ones, and we
don&rsquo;t need a manager to arrange for them.
Whom have you fellows in mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ed Kerr,&rdquo; spoke Holly promptly. &ldquo;He
knows the game from A to Z.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he was going to play,&rdquo; came quickly
from Tom. &ldquo;We need him on the nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t going to play this season,&rdquo; went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Holly. &ldquo;I heard him say so. He wants to save
himself for football, and he says he can&rsquo;t risk
going in for both. He&rsquo;d make a good manager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; agreed Tom, Sid and Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but did you hear the latest?&rdquo; asked
Snail Looper, gliding along, almost like the reptile
he was christened after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s talk of Ford Fenton for manager,&rdquo;
went on Snail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Ford!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be giving
us nothing all the while but &lsquo;my uncle says this&rsquo;
and &lsquo;my uncle used to do it that way&rsquo;! No Ford
for mine, though I like the chap fairly well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;We can stand
him, but not his uncle,&rdquo; for, be it known, Ford
Fenton, one of the sophomore students, was
the nephew of a man who had been a celebrated
coach at Randall in the years gone by. Ford
believed in keeping his memory green, and on
every possible, and some impossible, occasions
he would preface his remarks with &ldquo;My Uncle
says&rdquo; and then go on and tell something. It
got on the nerves of his fellows, and they &ldquo;rigged&rdquo;
him unmercifully about it, but Fenton could not
seem to take the hint. His uncle was a source
of pride to him, but it is doubtful if the former
coach knew how his reputation suffered at the
hands of his indiscrete youthful relative.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you Fenton had a chance for manager?&rdquo;
asked Sid Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bert Bascome is his press agent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bascome, the freshman?&rdquo; Phil wanted to
know, and Snail Looper nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he didn&rsquo;t get all the hazing that was
coming to him last fall,&rdquo; remarked Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to tackle him again. Kerr is the only logical
candidate for manager, if he isn&rsquo;t going to
play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; came in a chorus, as the lads
kept on toward the diamond.</p>

<p>Tom was doing some hard thinking. It was
a new responsibility for him&mdash;to run the team&mdash;and
he wanted a manager on whom he could
depend. If there was a contest over the place,
as seemed likely from what Snail Looper had
said, it would mean perhaps a dividing of interests,
and lack of support for the team. He did
not like the prospect, but he knew better than to
tell his worries to the players now. At present
he wanted to get them into some kind of shape,
after a winter of comparative idleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Mr. Leighton,&rdquo; observed Phil,
as a young, and pleasant-faced gentleman was
seen strolling toward the diamond. &ldquo;Everybody
work hard now&mdash;no sloppy work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; assented Tom. &ldquo;Fellows,
what I want most to bring out this season,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
went on, &ldquo;is some good hitting. Good batting
wins games, other things being equal. We&rsquo;ve
got to bat to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; put in Dutch Housenlager,
coming up then, and, with his usual horse
play trying to trip Tom. &ldquo;You are the worst
hitter on the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; admitted Tom good naturedly,
as he gave Dutch a welt on the chest, which
made that worthy gasp. &ldquo;My strong point isn&rsquo;t
batting, and I know it. I can pitch a little, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re there with the goods when it comes
to twirling,&rdquo; called out Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m going to depend on you fellows
for the stick work,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;But
let&rsquo;s get down to business. The ground isn&rsquo;t so
wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, let&rsquo;s see what we can do,&rdquo; proposed
the coach, and presently balls were being
pitched and batted to and fro, grounders were
being picked up by Bricktop Molloy, who excelled
in his position of shortstop, while Jerry
and Joe Jackson, the Jersey twins, with Phil
Clinton, who on this occasion filled, respectively,
the positions of right, left and center field were
catching high flies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a practice game,&rdquo; proposed Tom.
&ldquo;I want to see if I have any of my curves left.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Two scrub nines were soon picked out, and a
game was gotten under way. It was &ldquo;ragged
and sloppy&rdquo; as Holly Cross said, but it served
to warm up the lads, and to bring out strong and
weak points, which was the object sought.</p>

<p>The team, of which Tom was just then the
temporary captain, won by a small margin, and
then followed some coaching instructions from
Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do for to-day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be at it
again to-morrow, and we&rsquo;ll soon be in shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The players and their admirers&mdash;lads who had
not made the team&mdash;strolled off the diamond.
Tom, walking along with Phil and Sid, suddenly
put his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just my luck!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m broke,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;and I want to
get a new shirt. Phil, lend me a couple of dollars.
I&rsquo;ll get my check from dad to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the same boat, old man,&rdquo; was the rueful
reply. &ldquo;Tackle Sid here, I saw him with a
bunch of money yesterday. He can&rsquo;t have spent
it all since, for he isn&rsquo;t in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the thing,&rdquo; assented Tom. &ldquo;Fork over
a couple of bones, Sid. I&rsquo;ll let you have it directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; fairly stammered the
second baseman, for that was the position Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had picked out for his chum, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t but fifty
cents until I get my allowance, or until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and
he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;You must have slathered
it away last night then, when you were out,
for I saw you with a bundle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he stopped, for he saw a queer look
come over Sid&rsquo;s face. The second baseman
blushed, and was about to make reply, when Phil
remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Sid. I hadn&rsquo;t any right
to make that crack. Of course I&mdash;er&mdash;you understand&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Sid quickly. &ldquo;I was
a little flush yesterday, but I had a sudden demand
on me, Tom, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it!&rdquo; interrupted Tom. &ldquo;I
dare say I can get trusted at Ballman&rsquo;s for a
shirt. I&rsquo;m going out to-night, or I wouldn&rsquo;t need
a clean one, and my duds haven&rsquo;t come back
from the laundry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know my sister was going out to-night,&rdquo;
fired Phil, for Tom had been rather &ldquo;rushing&rdquo;
Ruth Clinton of late, &ldquo;rushing&rdquo; being the
college term for accompanying a young lady to
functions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she doesn&rsquo;t have to ask you,&rdquo; retorted
the captain. &ldquo;But I understood you and Miss
Tyler&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak of trolley cars, and you&rsquo;ll hear the
gong,&rdquo; put in Sid suddenly. &ldquo;I believe your two
affinities are now approaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, he&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, looking
across the green campus. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Ruth, and
Madge Tyler is with her. I didn&rsquo;t know Ruth
was coming over from Fairview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve got a friend with them&mdash;there
are three girls,&rdquo; said Tom quickly. &ldquo;Sid, you&rsquo;re
right in it. There&rsquo;s one for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; cried the tall and good-looking
second baseman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an important
engagement,&rdquo; and he would have fled had not
Tom and Phil seized and held him, despite his
struggles, until Miss Ruth Clinton, Miss Madge
Tyler and the third young lady approached.
Whereat, seeing that his struggle to escape was
futile, as well as undignified, Sid gave it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ruth!&rdquo; cried Phil good-naturedly to
his sister, but his eyes sought those of Madge
Tyler. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trolley,&rdquo; was the demure answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to the Phi Beta theatrical with Mr. Parsons to-night,
and I thought I&rsquo;d save him the trouble of
coming for me. Madge and I are staying in
Haddonfield with friends of Miss Harrison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he moved closer to
Phil&rsquo;s pretty sister, while, somehow, Phil and
Madge seemed to drift together.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I almost forgot, you don&rsquo;t know Mabel,
do you, boys?&rdquo; asked Madge, with a merry laugh.
&ldquo;Miss Mabel Harrison. Mabel, allow me to
present to you Tom Parsons, champion pitcher of
the Randall &rsquo;varsity nine; Phil Clinton, who made
such a good showing on the gridiron last year,
he&rsquo;s Ruth&rsquo;s brother, you know, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she
paused as she turned to Sid Henderson, who was
moving about uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid Henderson, the only and original misogynist
of Randall college,&rdquo; finished Tom, with a mischievous
laugh. &ldquo;He is the only one in captivity,
but will eat from your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you for that,&rdquo; growled Sid in Tom&rsquo;s
ear, but the girls laughed, as did Phil and the
captain, and the introductions were completed.
Miss Harrison proved to be an exceptionally
pretty and vivacious girl, a fit companion for
Ruth and Madge. She was fond of sport, as she
soon announced, and Phil and Tom warmed to
her at once.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, Tom walked
along with Ruth, Phil with Miss Tyler, and that
left Sid nothing to do but to stroll at the side of
Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you play ball, too,&rdquo; she began as an opener,
looking at his uniform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;that is I play at it, sometimes,&rdquo;
floundered Sid, conscious of a big green grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
stain on one leg, where he had fallen in reaching
for a high fly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great!&rdquo; went on the girl, her blue
eyes flashing as she glanced up at Sid. Somehow
the lad&rsquo;s heart was beating strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only game&mdash;except football,&rdquo; he conceded.
&ldquo;Do you play&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I mean&mdash;of
course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just love football!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I hope
our team wins the championship this year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your team?&rdquo; and Sid was plainly puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean the boys of Fairview&mdash;I attend
there you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it, but I&rsquo;m glad to,&rdquo; spoke Sid,
wondering why he never before thought blue eyes
pretty. &ldquo;Do you live at the college?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; but you see I happened to come to
Haddonfield to stay over night with relatives,
and when I found Madge and Ruth were going
to a little affair here to-night, I asked them to
stay with me. It&rsquo;s such a jaunt back to the college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; agreed Sid. &ldquo;You and Miss
Tyler and Miss Clinton are great friends, I
judge,&rdquo; he went on, wondering what his next
sentence would be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we are. Aren&rsquo;t they perfectly sweet
girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid with such enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that his companion looked at him in some surprise,
her flashing eyes completing the work already
begun by their first glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t care for&mdash;that is&mdash;was
that true what Mr. Parsons accused you of?&rdquo;
Miss Harrison asked. &ldquo;Is a misogynist a very
savage creature?&rdquo; she went on demurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all rot&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;they were
rigging you&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I mean&mdash;Oh, I say, Miss
Harrison, are you going to the Phi Beta racket
to-night&mdash;I mean the theatricals to-night?&rdquo; and
poor Sid floundered in deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Sid desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t been asked, I suppose,&rdquo;
and she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then would you mind&mdash;that is&mdash;I have two
tickets&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t expect to go. Now, if you
would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Henderson, don&rsquo;t go on my account!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t on your account&mdash;I mean&mdash;that
is&mdash;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go?&rdquo; and he seemed
in great distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should love to,&rdquo; she almost whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then will you&mdash;that is would you&mdash;er&mdash;that
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; answered Mabel, taking
pity on her companion&rsquo;s embarrassment. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it be lovely, with Madge and Ruth, and her
brother and Mr. Parsons. We&rsquo;ll be quite a
party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be immense!&rdquo; declared Sid with great
conviction. Thereafter he seemed to find it easier
to keep the conversation going.</p>

<p>The little group came to the end of the campus.
Phil, Tom, Madge and Ruth waited for Sid and
Mabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see you girls to-night,&rdquo; said Tom,
for he and his chum were anxious to get to their
room and &ldquo;tog up.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
pity Miss Harrison isn&rsquo;t going. If I had
thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Harrison is going!&rdquo; cried Sid with sudden
energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Tom and Phil together. Then,
realizing that it might embarrass the girl, Tom
added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! We&rsquo;ll all go together. Come on, Sid,
and get some of the outfield mud scraped away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls waved laughing farewells, and Sid,
rather awkwardly, shook hands with Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old chap?&rdquo; asked Tom
of him, when they were beyond hearing distance
of the girls. &ldquo;Are you afraid you&rsquo;ll never see
her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Sid.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonders will never cease,&rdquo; went on Phil.
&ldquo;To see our old misogynist being led along by a
pretty girl! However did you get up the spunk
to ask her to go to-night, sport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Sid again. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I got
a right to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course!&rdquo; agreed Tom quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a sign of regeneration, old man. I&rsquo;m glad to see
it! What color are her eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; answered Sid promptly, before he
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; laughed Phil and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get her photograph?&rdquo; asked Tom,
clinging to Phil, so strenuous was his mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll punch your head if you don&rsquo;t quit!&rdquo;
threatened Sid, and then, as he saw Wallops, the
messenger, coming toward him, with a letter, there
came to Sid&rsquo;s face a new look&mdash;one of fear, his
chums thought.</p>

<p>He read the note quickly, and stuffed it into
his pocket. Then he turned, and hastened after
the three girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Tom, for Sid
had acted strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to the theatricals to-night, after
all,&rdquo; was the surprising answer. &ldquo;I must apologize
to Miss Harrison. Will you take her, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; was the answer, and then, as Sid
hastened to make his excuses to the girl who, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a few minutes before, he had asked to accompany
him, his two chums looked at each other, and
shook their heads. The mystery about Sid was
deepening.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>ELECTING A MANAGER</h3>


<p>Sidney Henderson fairly broke into a run in
order to catch up to the three girls. They heard
him coming, and turned around, while Tom and
Phil, some distance off, were spectators of the
scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; burst out poor Sid pantingly, as he
came to a halt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Miss Harrison,
but&mdash;er&mdash;I can&rsquo;t take you to the theatricals
to-night, after all. I&rsquo;ve just received bad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news? Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; and the blue
eyes of the pretty girl, that had been merry and
dancing, as she chatted with Ruth and Madge,
took on a tender glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t that any one is sick, or&mdash;er&mdash;anything
like that,&rdquo; Sid hastened to add, for he saw
that she had misunderstood him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that
I have received a message&mdash;I have got to go
away&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain, but some one is
in trouble, and I&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; he blurted
out, feeling that he was making a pretty bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mess of it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged for Tom Parsons to
take you to the theatricals, Miss Harrison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve arranged for Mr. Parsons to take
me?&rdquo; There was no mistaking the anger in her
tones. Her blue eyes seemed to flash, and she
drew herself up proudly. Madge and Ruth, who
had shown some pity and anxiety at Sid&rsquo;s first
words, looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom will be very glad to take you,&rdquo;
went on the unfortunate Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; spoke Miss Harrison coldly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe I care to go to the theatricals after
all. Come on, girls, or we will be late for tea,&rdquo;
and without another look at Sid she turned aside
and walked on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I say, you know!&rdquo; burst out the second
baseman. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;that is&mdash;you see&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t possibly take you, as it is, and I
thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary for anyone to take me!&rdquo; retorted
Miss Harrison coldly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at all
important, I assure you. Good afternoon, Mr.
Henderson,&rdquo; and she swept away, leaving poor
Sid staring after her with bewilderment in his
eyes. It was his first attempt at an affair with
a maiden, and it had ended most disastrously.
He turned back to rejoin his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Tom, as Sid came up. &ldquo;Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it all right? Am I to have the pleasure of two
young ladies to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all wrong!&rdquo; blurted out Sid. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t understand girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rich!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Here you have
been despising them all your life, and now, when
you do make up to one, and something happens,
you say you can&rsquo;t understand them. No man
can, old chap. Look at Tom and me, here, and
we&rsquo;ve had our share of affairs, haven&rsquo;t we, old
sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; replied the pitcher. &ldquo;But
what&rsquo;s the row, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanged if I know. I told her I couldn&rsquo;t
possibly go to-night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell her why?&rdquo; interrupted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I said I had received word that I had
to go away, and&mdash;er&mdash;well I can&rsquo;t explain that
part of it even to you fellows. I&rsquo;ve got to go
away for a short time, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s fearfully
important, of course, or I wouldn&rsquo;t break a date
with a girl. I can&rsquo;t explain, except that I have
to go. I tried to tell her that; and then I said
I&rsquo;d arranged with you to take her, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; cried the amazed pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her I was going to have you take her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without asking her whether it would be agreeable
to her?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I didn&rsquo;t suppose that was necessary,
as you and Miss Clinton and Miss Tyler
were all going together. I just told her you&rsquo;d
take her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the chumps!&rdquo; burst out Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A double-barreled one!&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Sid wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; explained Phil. &ldquo;You ask a
pretty girl&mdash;and by the way, Sid, I congratulate
you on your choice, for she is decidedly fine looking&mdash;but,
as I say, you ask a pretty girl to go to
some doings, and when you find you can&rsquo;t go,
which is all right, of course, for that often happens,
why then, I say, you coolly tell her you have
arranged for her escort. You don&rsquo;t give her a
chance to have a word to say in the matter. Why,
man alive, it&rsquo;s just as if you were her guardian,
or grandfather, or something like that. A girl
likes to have a voice in these matters, you know.
My, my, Sid! but you have put your foot in it.
You should have gently, very gently, suggested
that Tom here would be glad to take her. Instead,
you act as though she had to accept your
choice. Oh, you doggoned old misogynist, I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;re hopeless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose she&rsquo;ll be mad?&rdquo; asked Sid
falteringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad? She&rsquo;ll never speak to you again,&rdquo; declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Tom, with a carefully-guarded wink at
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; spoke Sid mournfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to go away, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; and he
hastened on in advance of his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay out too late, and get caught by
Proc. Zane again,&rdquo; cautioned Phil, but Sid did
not answer.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil lingered in the gymnasium,
whither they went for a shower bath, and when
they reached their room, to put on clothes other
than sporting ones for supper, Sid was not in the
apartment. There was evidence that he had
come in, hastily dressed, and had gone out again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off,&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s mighty queer business,&rdquo; remarked
Phil. &ldquo;But come on, we&rsquo;ll get an early
grub, tog up, and go get the girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Miss Harrison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanged if I know,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be
glad to take her, of course, but I&rsquo;m not going to
mix up in Sid&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Well, come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of hearty appetites Tom and Phil did
not linger long at the table, and they were soon
back in their room, where they began to lay out
their dress suits, and to debate over which ties
they should wear. Tom had managed to borrow
a dress shirt, and so did not have to buy one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Phil,&rdquo; remarked the pitcher, as he almost
strangled himself getting a tight fifteen
collar to fit on the same size shirt, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t it
strike you as queer about Sid&mdash;I mean his chasing
off this way so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure does. This is the second time, and
each time he scoots off when he&rsquo;s had a note from
some one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember when he came back last night,
smelling so strong of tobacco?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; yet he doesn&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and that&rsquo;s the funny part of it. Then
there&rsquo;s the fact of him having no money to-day,
though he had a roll yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was silence in the small apartment, while
the clock ticked on. Tom, somewhat exhausted
by his struggle with his collar, sank down on the
ancient sofa, a cloud of dust, like incense, arising
around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s legions! My clothes will be a sight!&rdquo;
he cried, jumping up, and searching frantically
for a whisk broom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo; cried Phil, &ldquo;I just had my tie in the
right shape, and you&rsquo;ve knocked it all squee-gee!&rdquo;
for Tom in his excitement had collided with his
chum.</p>

<p>They managed to get dressed after a while&mdash;rather
a long while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Tom, as he took a final look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
at himself in the glass, for though he was not too
much devoted to dress or his own good looks,
much adornment of their persons must be excused
on the part of the talented pitcher and his
chum, on the score of the pretty girls with whom
they were to spend the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; announced Phil. &ldquo;Shall we leave
a light for Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. No telling when he&rsquo;ll be in.
Do you know, Phil, it seems rotten mean to mention
it, and I only do it to see if you have the
same idea I have, but I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
old Sid was gambling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gambling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Look how he&rsquo;s sneaked off these last
two nights, not saying where he&rsquo;s going, and acting
so funny about it. Then coming in late, all
perfumed with tobacco, and getting caught,
and not having any money and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, well,
hang it all! I know it won&rsquo;t go any further, or
I shouldn&rsquo;t mention it; but doesn&rsquo;t it look queer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil did not reply for a moment. He glanced
at Tom, as if to fathom his earnestness, and as
the two stood there, looking around their common
home, marked by the absence of Sid, the
fussy little alarm clock seemed to be repeating
over and over again the ugly word&mdash;&ldquo;gambler&mdash;gambler&mdash;gambler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Tom softly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to say it, but I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
replied Phil. &ldquo;Sid, of all chaps, though. It&rsquo;s
fierce!&rdquo; and then the two went out.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil called at the residence of Miss
Harrison&rsquo;s relatives for Madge and Ruth. Tom
tried, tactfully enough, to get Miss Harrison to
come to the theatricals with himself and Ruth,
but the blue-eyed girl pleaded a headache (always
a lady&rsquo;s privilege), and said she would stay at
home. Sid&rsquo;s name was not mentioned. Then
the four young people went off, leaving a rather
disconsolate damsel behind.</p>

<p>Sid was in bed when Tom and Phil returned,
and he did not say anything, or exhibit any signs
of being awake, so they did not disturb him, refraining
from even talking in whispers of the
jolly time they had had. There was a strong
smell of tobacco about Sid&rsquo;s clothes, but his chums
said nothing of this.</p>

<p>The next day Sid was moody and disconsolate.
He wrote several letters, tearing them up, one
after the other, but finally he seemed to hit on
one that pleased him, and went out to mail it.
Amid the torn scraps about his desk Phil and
Tom could not help seeing several which began
variously &ldquo;My dear Miss Harrison,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear Miss
Harrison,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Esteemed
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying to square himself,&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it bad&mdash;poor old Sid,&rdquo; added Phil.
&ldquo;It will all come out right in the end, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t seem to for Sid, since in the course
of the next week, when he had written again to
Miss Harrison asking her to go with him to a
dance, he received in return a polite little note,
pleading a previous engagement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Tom one afternoon, when
he and his crowd of players had thronged out on
the diamond, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re getting into some kind of
shape. Get back there, Dutch, while I try a few
curves, and then we&rsquo;ll have a practice game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pay particular attention to your batting,
fellows,&rdquo; cautioned Coach Leighton. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t improving
the way it ought, and I hear that Boxer
has some good stick-wielders this season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;ve got some one else on their
nine, too,&rdquo; added Bricktop Molloy. &ldquo;Have ye
heard the news, byes?&rdquo; for sometimes the red-haired
shortstop betrayed his genial Irish nature
by his brogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, what is it?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred Langridge is playing with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Langridge, the bully who used to be
here?&rdquo; cried one student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That same,&rdquo; retorted Bricktop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they hired him?&rdquo; inquired Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s taking some sort of a course at
Boxer Hall, I believe.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A course in concentrated meanness, I guess,&rdquo;
suggested Tom, as he thought of the dastardly
trick Langridge had tried to play on Phil during
the previous term.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter about that,&rdquo; came from the
coach. &ldquo;You boys want to improve your batting&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all. Your field work is fair, and I
haven&rsquo;t anything but praise for our battery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; chorused Tom and Dutch Housenlager,
making mock bows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But get busy, fellows,&rdquo; went on the coach.
&ldquo;Oh, by the way, captain, what about a manager?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Election to-night,&rdquo; answered Tom quickly.
&ldquo;The notice has been posted. Come on, we&rsquo;ll
have a scrub game. Five innings will be enough.
There ought to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began a voice from a
small knot of non-playing spectators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenton&rsquo;s wound up!&rdquo; cried Dutch, making an
attempt to penetrate the crowd and get at the
offending nephew of the former coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can him!&rdquo; shouted Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your uncle on ice!&rdquo; added Pete Backus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave him out after dark, and Proc. Zane will
catch him,&rdquo; came from Snail Looper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was only going to say,&rdquo; went on
Ford, but such a storm of protesting howls arose
that his voice was drowned.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the chap they talk of for manager,&rdquo;
said Phil to Tom disgustedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess it&rsquo;s all talk,&rdquo; remarked the
pitcher. &ldquo;We will rush Ed Kerr through, and
the season will soon start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scrub game began. It was not remarkable
for brilliant playing, either in the line of fielding
or batting. Tom, though, did some fine work in
pitching, and he and Dutch worked together like
well-built machines. Tom struck out three men,
one after the other, in the second inning, and repeated
the trick in the last. Sid Henderson rather
surprised the coach by making a safe hit every
time he was up, a record no one else approached
that day, for Rod Evert, who was doing the
&ldquo;twirling&rdquo; for the team opposed to Tom&rsquo;s, was
considered a good handler of the horsehide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, Henderson,&rdquo; complimented Mr.
Leighton. But Sid did not seem particularly
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody on hand for the election to-night,&rdquo;
commanded Tom, as the game ended, the pitcher&rsquo;s
team having won by a score of eight to four.</p>

<p>There was a large throng assembled in the
gymnasium that evening, for at Randall sports
reigned supreme in their seasons, and the annual
election of a baseball manager was something of
no small importance. For several reasons no
manager had been selected at the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
previous season, when Tom had been unanimously
selected as captain, and it now devolved upon the
students who were members of the athletic committee
to choose one.</p>

<p>As has been explained, among the players themselves,
or, rather, among the majority, Ed Kerr,
the catcher of the previous season was favored,
but, of late there had been activity looking to the
choosing of some one else.</p>

<p>There were vague rumors floating about the
meeting room, as Tom Parsons went up on the
platform, and called the assemblage to order. It
was noticed that Bert Bascome, a freshman who
was said to be quite wealthy, was the center of a
group of excited youths, of whom Ford Fenton
was one. Ford had tried for the &rsquo;varsity the
previous season, had failed, and was once more
in line. As for Bascome, he, too, wanted to
wear the coveted &ldquo;R.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Politics over there all right,&rdquo; observed Phil
Clinton to Dutch. &ldquo;Any idea of how strong they
are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe they can muster ten votes,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put Ed in all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom called for nominations for chairman, and
Mr. Leighton, who was in the hall, was promptly
chosen, he being acceptable to both sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all know what we are here for,&rdquo; began
the coach, &ldquo;and the sooner we get it over with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the better, I presume. Nominations for a manager
of the ball nine are in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson was on his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you speaking for yourself or your
brother?&rdquo; called Dutch.</p>

<p>Bang! went the chairman&rsquo;s gavel, but there
was a laugh at the joke, for Jerry and Joe, the
&ldquo;Jersey twins&rdquo; were always so much in accord
that what one did the other always sanctioned.
Yet the query of Dutch seemed to disturb Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he began again. &ldquo;I
wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help him along, Joe,&rdquo; sung out Snail Looper.
&ldquo;Jerry is going to make a wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, boys,&rdquo; pleaded the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; came from Ford Fenton,
indiscreetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muzzle him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get a policeman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn the hose on him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe he ever had an uncle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were some of the cries that greeted Ford.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! went the gavel, and order was
finally restored, but Fenton did not again venture
to address the chair.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; began Jerry Jackson once
more, and this time he secured a hearing, and
was recognized. &ldquo;I wish to place in nomination,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;a manager who, I am sure, will
fulfill the duties in the most acceptable manner;
one who knows the game from home plate to
third base, who has had large experience, who is
a jolly good fellow&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so long-winded about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us his name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to name Ford&rsquo;s uncle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more the horse-play, led by Dutch, broke
out.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! went Mr. Leighton&rsquo;s gavel again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I nominate Ed Kerr!&rdquo; sung out Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second it!&rdquo; came from his brother in a flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kerr has been nominated,&rdquo; spoke the
chairman. &ldquo;Are there any others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move the nominations be closed,&rdquo; came from
Tom quickly, but, before it could be seconded,
Bert Bascome was on his feet. He had a sneering,
supercilious air, that was in distinct bad
taste, yet he seemed to have a sort of following,
as, indeed, any youth in college may have, who
is willing to freely spend his money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; began Bascome,
and so anxious were the others to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
what was coming that they did not interrupt.
&ldquo;When I came to Randall college,&rdquo; went on the
freshman, with an air as if he had conferred a
great favor by his act, &ldquo;I was given to understand
that the spirit of sportsmanship and fair
play was a sort of a heritage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eating you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the goat?&rdquo; came the cries. Bert
flushed but went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Closing the nominations before more than one
name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nominations have not been closed,&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then am I out of order?&rdquo; inquired Bascome
sarcastically. He seemed to know parliamentary
law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the coach. &ldquo;You must speak
to the point, however. Have you a name to place
in nomination? Mr. Parsons&rsquo; motion was lost
for want of a second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i> a name to place in nomination,&rdquo; went
on Bert deliberately, &ldquo;and in doing so I wish to
state that I am actuated by no sense of feeling
against Mr. Kerr, whom I do not know. I simply
wish to see the spirit of sport well diversified
among the students, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question! Question!&rdquo; shouted several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name your man!&rdquo; demanded others.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Mr. Kerr is highly esteemed,&rdquo; continued
Bascome, holding his ground well, &ldquo;and I
honor him. I believe, however, that he belongs
to a certain crowd, or clique&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong!&rdquo; was a general shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; shouted Kerr, springing to
his feet, his face strangely white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bascome has the floor,&rdquo; spoke Mr.
Leighton quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name your man!&rdquo; was the cry from half a
score of youths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I nominate Ford Fenton for manager!&rdquo;
shouted Bascome, for he saw the rising temper
of some of the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second it,&rdquo; came from Henry Delfield, who
was the closest chum of the rich lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move the nominations close!&rdquo; cried Tom
quickly, and this time Phil Clinton seconded it.
The battle was on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two students have been nominated,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Leighton, when the usual formalities
had been completed. &ldquo;How will you vote
on them, by ballot or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show of hands!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;We want to
see who&rsquo;s with us and who&rsquo;s against us,&rdquo; he added
in a whisper to Phil and Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I demand a written ballot,&rdquo; called out Bascome.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We will vote on that,&rdquo; decided the chairman,
and it went overwhelmingly in favor of a show
of hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; exulted Tom, when this test
had demonstrated how few were with Bascome&mdash;a
scant score.</p>

<p>A moment later the real voting was under
way, by a show of hands, Kerr&rsquo;s name being
voted on first. He had tried to make a speech,
but had been induced to keep quiet.</p>

<p>It was as might have been expected. Possibly
had the ballot been a secret one more might have
voted for Fenton, but some freshmen saw which
way the wind was blowing, changing their votes
after having declared for a secret ballot, and all
of Bascome&rsquo;s carefully laid plans, and his scheming
for several weeks past, to get some sort of
control of the nine, came to naught. Fenton
received nine votes, and Kerr one hundred and
twenty. It was a pitiful showing, and Fenton
soon recognized it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I move the election of Mr. Kerr be made
unanimous!&rdquo; he cried, and that did more to offset
his many references to his uncle than anything else
he could have done. Bascome was excitedly whispering
to some of his chums, but when Fenton&rsquo;s
motion was put it was carried without a vote in
opposition, and Kerr was the unanimous choice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said Phil with
a sigh of relief, as he and his chums drifted from
the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now we&rsquo;ll begin to play ball in earnest,&rdquo;
added Tom. &ldquo;Come on, Sid, I&rsquo;ll take you and
Phil down to Hoffman&rsquo;s and treat you to some
ice cream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m going out this evening,&rdquo; said Sid,
and he blushed a trifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, you old dub?&rdquo; asked Tom, almost
before he thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call on Miss Harrison,&rdquo; was
the somewhat unexpected answer.</p>

<h3>RANDALL AGAINST BOXER</h3>


<p>Tom and Phil stood staring at each other as
Sid walked on ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that get your goat?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure would,&rdquo; admitted Phil. &ldquo;He must
have made up with her, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How it came about Sid, of course, would never
tell. It was too new and too delightful an experience
for him&mdash;to actually be paying attentions
to some girl&mdash;to make it possible to discuss the
matter with his chums. Sufficient to say that in
the course of two weeks more there was another
photograph in the room of the inseparables.</p>

<p>Baseball matters began to occupy more and
more attention at Randall. The team was being
whipped into shape, and between Tom, Ed Kerr
and the coach the lads were beginning to get rid
of the uncertainty engendered by a winter of
comparative idleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you arranged any games yet?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Tom of Ed one afternoon, following some sharp
practice on the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We play Boxer Hall next week,&rdquo; answered
the manager. &ldquo;And I do hope we win. It means
so much at the beginning of the season. How
is the team, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean ours or theirs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, I should say,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know who&rsquo;ll pitch against you when we
play Boxer, I dare say,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Leighton,
who had joined Tom and Ed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your old enemy, Langridge. He&rsquo;s displaced
Dave Ogden, who twirled for them last season.
But you&rsquo;re not frightened, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it! If there&rsquo;s anything that will
make our fellows play fierce ball it&rsquo;s to know
that Langridge&mdash;the fellow who almost threw
our football team&mdash;is going to play against them.
I couldn&rsquo;t ask a better tonic. Will they play on
our grounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve got to go there. But don&rsquo;t let that
worry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was sharp practice for the next few
days, and Tom and his chums were put through
&ldquo;a course of sprouts&rdquo; to quote Holly Cross. They
did some ragged work, under the eagle eye of the
coach, and things began to look bad, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
only the last remnant of staleness disappearing,
for the day before the game there was exhibited
a noticeable stiffness, and a confidence that augured
well for Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The batting still leaves something to be desired,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Leighton, as practice was
over for the day. &ldquo;I have great hopes of Sid
Henderson, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If what?&rdquo; asked the coach quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t go back on himself,&rdquo; finished
the pitcher, but that was not what he had intended
to say. He was thinking of Sid&rsquo;s queer actions
of late&mdash;wondering what they portended, and
what was the meaning of his chum&rsquo;s odd absences,
for, only the night previous, Sid had gone out,
following the receipt of a note, and had come in
late, smelling vilely of tobacco. Fortunately he
had escaped detection by the proctor, but he offered
no explanation, and his manner was disturbed,
and not like his usual one.</p>

<p>As for Sid, well might his chums be puzzled
about him. He seemed totally to have changed,
not only in manner but in his attitude toward Tom
and Phil. There was a new look on his face.
Several times, of late, since his acquaintance with
Miss Harrison, and the reconciliation following
his little &ldquo;<i>de trop faux pas</i>,&rdquo; as Tom termed it,
Sid had been caught day dreaming. Phil or Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
would look up from their studying to see Sid,
with a book falling idly from his hands, gazing
vacantly into a corner of the room, or looking
abstractedly at his side of the wall space, as
though calculating just where would be the best
spot for a certain girl&rsquo;s picture.</p>

<p>It was a most enthralling occupation for Sid&mdash;this
day dreaming. It was a new experience&mdash;a
deliciously tender and sweet one&mdash;for no young
man can be any the worse for thinking and dreaming
of a fine-charactered girl, albeit one who is
amazingly pretty; in fact he is the better for it.
In Sid&rsquo;s case his infatuation had come so suddenly
that it was overwhelming. In the past he
had either been shy with girls, or had not cared
enough for them to be more than decently polite.
But now everything was different. Though he
had seen her but a few times, he could call to mind
instantly the very way in which she turned her
head when she addressed him. He could see the
slight lifting of the eyebrows as she asked a question,
the sparkle that came into the blue eyes, that
held a hint of mischief. He could hear her rippling
laugh, and he knew in what a tantalizing
way a certain ringlet escaped from the coils of
her hair, and fell upon her neck.</p>

<p>Often in class the lecturer would suddenly call
his name, and Sid would start, for he had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
his thoughts afar, and it required a sort of wireless
message to bring them back.</p>

<p>The day of the Boxer game could not have
been better. There had been a slight shower in
the night, but only sufficient to lay the dust, and
it was just cool enough to be delightful. The
Randall players and their supporters, including
a crowd of enthusiastic &ldquo;rooters,&rdquo; a number of
substitutes and a mascot, in the shape of a puppy,
fantastically attired, made the trip to Boxer Hall
in special trolleys, hired stage coaches and some
automobiles. Bert Bascome owned an automobile,
and he made much of himself in consequence.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd in the grand stands
when the Randall players arrived, and they were
received with cheers, for the sporting spirit between
the two colleges was a generous one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, what a lot of girls!&rdquo; remarked Tom to
Sid and Phil, as the three chums looked over
toward the seats, which were a riot of color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all the Fairview students are here to-day,&rdquo;
spoke Phil. &ldquo;Ruth said she and Miss
Tyler were coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Sid, and then he
stopped, blushing like a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Harrison is coming with them,&rdquo;
replied Phil, with a laugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look &rsquo;em up
after the game&mdash;if we win.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, if we lose?&rdquo; asked Sid quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the nerve, if we let Boxer Hall take
the first game of the season from us,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>

<p>Fast and snappy practice began, and it was
somewhat of a revelation to the Randall players
to note the quick work on the part of their rivals.
In getting around the bases, batting out flies, getting
their fingers on high balls and low grounders,
Boxer Hall seemed to have improved very much
over last year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our work cut out for us,&rdquo; remarked
Phil in a low voice to his two chums. &ldquo;Say,
Langridge has some speed, too. Look at that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new pitcher of Boxer Hall was throwing
to Stoddard, the catcher, and the balls landed in
the pocket of the big mitt with a vicious thud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Sid, here, will knock out a
couple of home runs,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you,
Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope I don&rsquo;t fan the air. How are
his curves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good, for the first few innings,&rdquo; answered
Tom. &ldquo;After that you can find &rsquo;em easy
enough. He wears down&mdash;at least he did last
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The practice came to an end. The preliminaries
were arranged, and, with the privilege of
the home team coming last to the bat, Randall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
went in the initial inning. The two teams were
made up as follows:</p>


<p class="roster">RANDALL COLLEGE</p>

<p class="noi blockquot">
Sid Henderson, <i>second base</i>.<br />
William Housenlager, <i>catcher</i>.<br />
Phil Clinton, <i>first base</i>.<br />
Tom Parsons, <i>pitcher</i>.<br />
Dan Woodhouse, <i>third base</i>.<br />
Jerry Jackson, <i>right field</i>.<br />
Bob Molloy, <i>shortstop</i>.<br />
Joe Jackson, <i>left field</i>.<br />
Holman Cross, <i>center field</i>.<br />
</p>


<p class="roster">BOXER HALL</p>

<p class="noi blockquot">
Lynn Ralling, <i>second base</i>.<br />
Hugh McGherity, <i>right field</i>.<br />
Roy Conklin, <i>left field</i>.<br />
Arthur Flood, <i>center field</i>.<br />
George Stoddard, <i>catcher</i>.<br />
Pinkerton Davenport, <i>first base</i>.<br />
Fred Langridge, <i>pitcher</i>.<br />
Bert Hutchin, <i>third base</i>.<br />
Sam Burton, <i>shortstop</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Sid, show &rsquo;em what you can do,&rdquo; advised
Mr. Leighton, as Sid selected a bat, and
walked up to the plate. He faced Langridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and noted the grim and almost angry look in
the eyes of the former pitcher on the Randall
&rsquo;varsity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him give you a nice one,&rdquo; called Bean
Perkins, who was ready to shout for victory.</p>

<p>A ball came whizzing toward Sid, and so
sure was he that he was going to be hit that he
dodged back, but he was surprised when it neatly
curved out, went over the plate, and the umpire
called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike One!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a howl of protest on the part of
the Randall sympathizers, but it died away when
Mr. Leighton held up a warning hand.</p>

<p>Sid struck viciously at the next ball, and felt
a thrill of joy as he felt the impact, but, as he
rushed away toward first he heard the umpire&rsquo;s
call of &ldquo;Foul; strike!&rdquo; and he came back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for a good one,&rdquo; counseled Phil, in a
low voice. &ldquo;Make him give you a pretty one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge sent in another swift curve and Sid
struck at it. Another foul resulted, and he began
to wonder what he was up against. The next attempt
was a ball, for Langridge threw away out,
but Sid saw coming a moment later, what he
thought would make at least a pretty one-bagger.
He swung viciously at it, but missed it clean, and
walked to the bench somewhat chagrined.</p>

<p>Dutch Housenlager, with a smile of confidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
walked up next. He was cool, and Langridge,
having struck out Sid, seemed to lose some of
his anger. He delivered a good ball&mdash;an in-shoot&mdash;and
Dutch caught it on the end of his
bat. It seemed to promise well, but Roy Conklin,
out on left field was right under it, and Dutch
ingloriously came back from first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Phil, line one out!&rdquo; pleaded Tom, as
his chum selected his bat, and Phil struck at the
first ball, sending a hot liner right past the shortstop.</p>

<p>Phil got to first, and stole second when Tom
came up, making it only by a close margin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A home run, Tom,&rdquo; begged the coach, and
Tom nodded with a grim smile on his face. But
alas for hopes! He knocked a fly, which the right
fielder got without much difficulty, and the first
half of the initial inning was over with a goose-egg
in the space devoted to Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we&rsquo;re finding him,&rdquo; consoled
Tom, as he walked to his box.</p>

<p>Lynn Ralling was up first for Boxer Hall, and
Tom resolved to strike him out, if it was at all
possible. It was his first pitching in a league
game that season, and he was a trifle nervous.
Still he held himself well in hand, and, though
the first two attempts were called &ldquo;balls&rdquo; the next
three went down as strikes. Ralling refused to
swing on two of them, but the last one seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to him as just right, but Tom had the satisfaction
of striking him out. McGherity, the next man up,
was a notoriously heavy hitter, and Tom purposely
gave him a pass to first. He struck out
Roy Conklin, but something went wrong with the
next man, Arthur Flood, who knocked a two-bagger.
Then George Stoddard got to first on a
swift grounder, that, somehow rolled through the
legs of Bricktop, much to that hero&rsquo;s disgust.
There was some good playing the rest of the inning,
George being caught napping on second,
and it ended with two runs in favor of Boxer
Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to wake up!&rdquo; decided Mr. Leighton
grimly. &ldquo;Put a little more ginger into it,
boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with our team?&rdquo; Bean Perkins
demanded to know in his loudest voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; was the response, from scores
of throats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song,&rdquo; called
Bean, and as Dan Woodhouse went up to the
bat in the beginning of the second inning the
strains of &ldquo;<i>Aut vincere aut mori</i>,&rdquo; welled out over
the diamond. But the inspiring melody that,
more than once had been the means of inspiring
a faint-hearted team to victory, seemed to be of
no effect now. Not a man got further than second,
and another goose egg went up to the credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of Randall. But a similar dose was served to
Boxer in the same inning, and when Randall
opened the third with Holly Cross at the bat,
there was much wonder, and not a little disappointment.
What would Holly do? He soon
showed by knocking a two bagger, but, alas for
what followed. Though he managed to steal to
third, Langridge pitched so well that those who
followed were struck out, and there was another
white circle.</p>

<p>It was duplicated for Boxer Hall, however,
and there began to be talk of a &ldquo;pitchers&rsquo; battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find Langridge this inning,&rdquo; prophesied
Tom, and it was partly justified, for one run came
in, which sent the grand stand where the Randallites
were gathered wild with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, give &rsquo;em that song&mdash;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re
going to wallop you now,&rsquo;&rdquo; called Bean, and there
arose a riot of &ldquo;melody.&rdquo; In the fifth inning
neither side scored, and then came the turn of
Captain Tom&rsquo;s men again. They delighted their
supporters by pulling down two runs, and making
the score three to two in their favor. Then, when
Boxer Hall came up for their inning, they hammered
out two runs, which sent Randall stock
down to zero again with the score of four to
three against them.</p>

<p>The seventh and eighth innings saw big circles
chalked up in the frames of both teams, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Tom and his men worked hard to bring in at
least another run. But it was not to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, it&rsquo;s our last chance,&rdquo; remarked
the coach, as Holly Cross stepped up in the ninth,
his teeth fairly gritting together. &ldquo;Two runs to
win&mdash;that is if we hold &rsquo;em down when they come
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that part,&rdquo; guaranteed Tom grimly.</p>

<p>From the grand stands there were shouts and
yells of encouragement&mdash;and otherwise. Bean
led his cohorts in, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Your Last Chance, Boys&mdash;Soak
It!&rdquo; a Randall classic of the diamond.
Well, Holly did &ldquo;soak&rdquo; it, with the result that he
knocked the prettiest three-bagger seen in many
a day. Then came Sid&rsquo;s turn. Two strikes were
called on him, and then came a foul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s going to fan,&rdquo; whispered Tom
to the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch him,&rdquo; advised Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>There was a reassuring &ldquo;thump&rdquo; as the next
ball reached Sid. Away sailed the sphere right
over the center fielder&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beaut! It&rsquo;s a beaut! Run! Run!
Run!&rdquo; yelled the frenzied students. Holly was
legging it in from third and my! how Sid was
running! Low down, and like the wind! The
frantic center fielder was racing for the ball amid
the daisies. On and on came Sid!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A home run! A home run!&rdquo; screamed Tom
and his players, jumping up and down and over
the bench in their excitement. Around the bases
came Sid, following Holly. The second baseman
swung around third and started for home, but the
ball was on the way. Would he beat it?</p>

<p>He did, by about a second, rushing in almost
exhausted, over the plate which Holly had just
crossed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Wow! Wow!&rdquo; cried Sid&rsquo;s and Holly&rsquo;s
mates. &ldquo;That wins the game!&rdquo; and they hugged
Sid and his chum. &ldquo;Two Runs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The game is not won yet,&rdquo; said the coach,
more soberly. &ldquo;We need more runs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they couldn&rsquo;t get them. There was a sudden
improvement on the part of Langridge, who
had begun to weaken, and he struck out the next
two men, the third getting out on a bingle. But
the score was five to four in favor of Randall,
and if Tom could hold them down, and strike
out three men, the game was theirs. Could he
do it?</p>

<p>There was a great strain on everyone as the
Randall team went out to the field. From the
grand stand came softly the &ldquo;Conquer or Die&rdquo;
song, and Tom felt a sense of moisture in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strike &rsquo;em out!&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>How he did it is college history to this day.
Calmly he faced the first man, and delivered a
ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; howled the umpire, and this time it
was Boxer Hall that sent up a groan of protest.
But it was silenced, and in two more balls delivered
over the plate with faultless precision, but
with puzzling curves, Tom had one down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only two more,&rdquo; called Phil to him encouragingly.</p>

<p>Tom nodded. How he did pitch! The balls
sounded like guns when they hit Dutch Housenlager&rsquo;s
big mitt, but he held them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three strikes&mdash;batter out!&rdquo; yelled the umpire,
and the second man threw down his stick and
walked disgustedly to the bench.</p>

<p>George Stoddard was up next. Tom was afraid
of him. He delivered a puzzling slow drop,
but Stoddard got under it for a foul.</p>

<p>Tom breathed a bit easier. Two more
chances. He sent one of his best out shoots, and
Stoddard foolishly bit at it. The ball just grazed
the bat, and bounded up into the air. Dutch made
a desperate effort for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo; yelled the crowd, as it went
over the back grand stand.</p>

<p>The umpire threw Tom a new ball. He hated
to use it, as the other seemed just right. But the
one that had gone over the stand was slow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
being returned. Dutch signalled for another
drop, but Tom shook his head. He wanted to
try a delicate in-curve.</p>

<p>It seemed that the players and spectators were
scarcely breathing&mdash;it was the critical point of
the game, yet with two down Boxer Hall could
scarcely hope to win. Yet there was a chance.
Tom delivered the ball. Stoddard swung at it
with such force that he turned completely around.
But the new, white ball was safe in the mitt of
Dutch Housenlager. Stoddard had struck out&mdash;there
were three down for Boxer in the ending of
the ninth, and not a run. Randall had won&mdash;the
score being five to four.</p>

<p>Then such a chorus of yells as went up! Even
Bean Perkins could scarcely be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Wow! Wow!&rdquo; cried Dutch, seizing
Holly Cross around the waist, and doing a dance
with him about the bench. &ldquo;We did it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great work, boys!&rdquo; cried the coach. &ldquo;I congratulate
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Randall!&rdquo; proposed Pinkey
Davenport for Boxer Hall, and the yells came
with spontaneous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three and a tiger for Boxer Hall!&rdquo; yelled
Tom, and his men nearly split their throats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on! Clean up, and then for some fun!&rdquo;
cried Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go hunt up the girls, as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
as we look decent again,&rdquo; he suggested to Tom
and Sid, who nodded joyfully.</p>

<p>Langridge passed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one game,&rdquo; growled the defeated
pitcher. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do you fellows next time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the chance,&rdquo; retorted Tom good
naturedly.</p>

<p>A little later the victorious pitcher, and his two
chums, having donned their street clothes, were
strolling across the field toward a knot of girls.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>THE ACCUSATION</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it glorious!&rdquo; cried Madge Tyler, as
Tom and his chums came up. &ldquo;I was just gripping
the seat when you threw that last ball, Mr. Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So was I,&rdquo; admitted Ruth. &ldquo;Phil, I&rsquo;m proud
of you, even if you are my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Phil. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for Sid&rsquo;s home run we wouldn&rsquo;t have been in it.
The fellows who followed him fanned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be very proud, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo;
remarked Mabel Harrison, who looked charming
in some sort of a soft, clinging dress which I&rsquo;m
not going to describe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was just luck,&rdquo; spoke Sid modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck nothing, you old walloper!&rdquo; cried Tom,
thumping his chum on the back. &ldquo;You just laid
for that one, and lambasted it out where the buttercups
and daisies grow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how poetic!&rdquo; cried Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some ice cream would sound a heap-sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
more poetic,&rdquo; decided Phil. &ldquo;What do you girls
say? Will you come and have some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve provided a little treat for you boys,&rdquo;
said Ruth quickly. &ldquo;By rare good luck Miss Philock,
the ogress of Fairview Institute, is away to-day,
and I secured permission from the assistant
to have a little tea in one of the rooms. We
three girls will feed you lions of the diamond, if
you promise not to eat up all the charlotte russe
and lady fingers I have provided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the appetite
of a butterfly, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; interrupted Sid, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; invited Phil&rsquo;s sister. &ldquo;We
are just in time to catch a trolley for Fairview.
I have a letter from home for you, Phil,&rdquo; she
added.</p>

<p>A little later a merry crowd of young people
were walking up the campus of the co-educational
institution, where the three girls were pursuing
their studies. It was Saturday afternoon, and a
half holiday for everyone. Ruth, having secured
permission, escorted her brother and his two
chums to one of the rooms set aside for the use
of the girl students in which to entertain their
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sis, this is quite a spread!&rdquo; complimented
Phil, as he saw the elaborate preparations
in the shape of paper napkins, in the colors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Randall&mdash;yellow and maroon&mdash;spread about on
the table, and as he noted the flowers and the
rather more generous &ldquo;feed&rdquo; than that indicated
when his sister had named lady fingers and charlotte
russe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we provided this in case you won,&rdquo; replied
Ruth, &ldquo;but if you had lost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in case we had lost?&rdquo; asked Sid, who
was close to Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were going to eat it all ourselves,&rdquo; finished
Madge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And be ill afterward,&rdquo; interjected Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad, for more reasons than two, that we won;
eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;er&mdash;if it&rsquo;s all the same to you, let&rsquo;s
eat,&rdquo; suggested Phil, with the freedom of an elder
brother.</p>

<p>There was a merry time. The fair hostesses
had provided coffee and sandwiches, with plenty
of ice cream and cake, and when they had been
at the table for some time, Phil, with a sigh of
satisfaction, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad this didn&rsquo;t happen before the game,
fellows, or I couldn&rsquo;t have caught even a pop
fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ditto here,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Pass the macaroons,
Sid. I see you and Miss Harrison trying
to hide them between you.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No such a thing!&rdquo; retorted the second baseman,
while the blue-eyed girl blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil, I promised to get you the letter from
home!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Ruth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run up
to my room for it. Excuse me,&rdquo; and she darted
off, to return presently with two missives. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
one for you, Mabel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I found it on
your dresser. It must have come in after the
regular mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter for me,&rdquo; repeated Miss Harrison in
some bewilderment. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unexpected ones are always the best,&rdquo; ventured
Sid, and when Tom whispered &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; at
the attempt on the part of his chum to shine in
the society of ladies, Sid muttered a threat to
punch the captain when they got outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother is well, and dad as busy as ever,&rdquo;
remarked Ruth as she handed her letter to her
brother, and passed the other to Miss Harrison.
The latter gazed curiously at the missive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know this writing,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I
wonder who it can be from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better open it and see,&rdquo; suggested Sid.</p>

<p>She tore open the envelope, which fluttered to
the ground, as she took out a piece of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how funny!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Harrison.
&ldquo;There is nothing but a Haddonfield newspaper
clipping, and&mdash;and&mdash;why it seems to be about
you, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
she stammered. &ldquo;How odd! Of course
it must be some one else. Just listen,&rdquo; and she
read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;During a raid on an alleged gambling house
kept by Tony Belato in Dartwell, just outside of
Haddonfield on Thursday night, a number of
college students, believed to be from Boxer Hall,
Fairview or Randall were captured. Several got
away, and those who were locked up gave false
names, it is believed. One young man, who stated
that he was Sidney Henderson, fought the officers,
and was not subdued until after a struggle. None
of the college boys seemed to know him, but it
was stated that he had lost heavily in playing
poker. The prisoners were fined ten dollars each,
and this morning were discharged by Judge Perkins
with a warning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment following Miss
Harrison&rsquo;s reading of the clipping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Tom at last, and his
words seemed to break the spell. &ldquo;Arrested in a
gambling raid&mdash;Sid Henderson? Of course it
must be some one else! But who sent the clipping
to you, Miss Harrison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was her answer, as she looked
full at Sid. &ldquo;It was a piece of impertinence, at
any rate,&rdquo; and she began to tear up the newspaper
item. &ldquo;Of course it wasn&rsquo;t you, Mr. Henderson.
I should not have read it. I don&rsquo;t suppose you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
were within miles of the place where it happened.
These newspaper reporters are so careless, sometimes.
You weren&rsquo;t there, were you?&rdquo; she went
on.</p>

<p>As they all remembered it afterward it seemed
strange that Miss Harrison should so insist on
her question, but, later, it was explained that her
family, as well as herself, had an extraordinary
abhorrence of any games of chance, since her
brother had once been fleeced by gamblers, and
there had been some disgrace attached to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t there; were you?&rdquo; repeated Miss
Harrison, and her eyes were fastened on those of
Sid.</p>

<p>His face was strangely white, and his hands
trembled. His chums looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t arrested in any raid,&rdquo; he said, and
his voice was husky. The girl seemed to catch
at the evasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you there?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I&mdash;of
course&mdash;I have no right to ask you that&mdash;but&mdash;this
clipping, coming to me&mdash;as it did&mdash;and under
the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t arrested,&rdquo; faltered Sid.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all&mdash;it&rsquo;s all a mistake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost instantly there came to Phil and Tom
at the same time a memory of Sid&rsquo;s queer actions
of late&mdash;of his strange absences from college&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his hurried departures on receiving notes&mdash;of
the smell of tobacco on his clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you at the gambling place, in Dartwell?&rdquo;
asked Miss Harrison coldly, and it was
not until later that the others understood her
strange insistence and hatred of games of chance.
&ldquo;Were you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t arrested!&rdquo; blurted out Sid. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;I was in Dartwell that night&mdash;but&mdash;but
it is all a mistake&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see how my
name got in the paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes these matters get out in spite of all
that is done to keep them quiet,&rdquo; remarked the
girl, and her voice sounded to Sid like the clash
of steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I wasn&rsquo;t arrested&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t there&mdash;that
is, I wasn&rsquo;t gambling&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;Oh, won&rsquo;t
you believe me? Won&rsquo;t you take my word for
it?&rdquo; He was pleading with her now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any right to control your actions,&rdquo;
said Miss Harrison. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who sent me
this clipping&mdash;nor why&mdash;I wish I had never seen
it,&rdquo; and her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;Yet when I
ask you if you were there, it seems as if you could
say yes or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried poor Sid. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
wasn&rsquo;t arrested. I was there&mdash;yes, in&mdash;in Dartwell
that night&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;it&rsquo;s a secret&mdash;it&mdash;Oh,
won&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Harrison turned and looked full at him.
The others were watching the little tragedy that
was being enacted before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you believe me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll explain&mdash;some
time,&rdquo; faltered Sid desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but unless you care to tell me everything,
and explain why you were in a gambling
house I can&rsquo;t accept your excuses,&rdquo; she said
coldly. &ldquo;I cannot retain the friendship of a person
who goes to gambling places. I must ask you
to excuse me,&rdquo; and holding her head high, though
there were tears in her blue eyes, and a sob in her
trembling voice, she turned and left the room.</p>

<p>Ruth and Madge looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Phil to Tom huskily, and
they filed out. Sid remained long enough to pick
up the envelope that had contained the accusing
clipping, and then he followed. None of the three
chums spoke until they were out on the campus.
Then Phil turned to Sid and demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in blazes is the matter? If that didn&rsquo;t
mean you, and you weren&rsquo;t there, why didn&rsquo;t you
say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Oh, fellows,
don&rsquo;t go back on me now. I&rsquo;ll explain&mdash;some
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we won&rsquo;t go back on you,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;Even if you were playing the ponies or
shuffling a deck of cards, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
It&rsquo;s your money to lose, if you want to, only I
didn&rsquo;t think you cared for such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; blurted out Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t explain! Don&rsquo;t desert me now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to,&rdquo; spoke Phil more gently,
&ldquo;only it hurts with a girl like Miss Harrison to
have a thing like this come out. She&rsquo;s done with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Sid miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Tom, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t worry over
that. You&rsquo;ve got to bat for us to win, as you did
to-day,&rdquo; for he feared Sid would go to pieces, such
was the wild look on his face.</p>

<h3>GETTING BACK AT &ldquo;PITCHFORK&rdquo;</h3>


<p>The three chums were not very jolly as they
began their return to Randall college, whither the
baseball team had preceded them some time before.
Sid, Phil and Tom had sent their suits back
with some of their friends while they attended
the little tea given by Ruth Clinton&mdash;the tea which
had had such an unfortunate ending.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil conversed in low tones about the
team and the showing made that day in the first
formal game of the season, but as for Sid, he
kept to himself in one corner of the electric car,
and there was a moody look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking it hard,&rdquo; observed Phil in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>Sid stalked into the room ahead of his chums
and threw himself down on the old sofa, which
creaked and groaned with his weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, old man,&rdquo; called Phil good naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had that in the family for three terms,
now, and it&rsquo;s a regular heirloom. Don&rsquo;t smash it
for us. Remember what a time we had last term,
patching it up, and moving it here from our old
room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and how Langridge was upset trying to
get down stairs past us,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;Have a
little regard for the sofa, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang the sofa!&rdquo; burst out the lad, and
then Tom and Phil knew it was useless to talk to
him. Phil crossed the room softly and sat cautiously
down in the old armchair. Tom looked
at the alarm clock, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove! If it hasn&rsquo;t stopped! Must be something
wrong,&rdquo; and he hurriedly wound it, and
then started it by the gentle process of pounding
it on the edge of the table. Soon the fussy clicking
was again heard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; went on
the pitcher, in relieved tones. &ldquo;Gave me heart
disease at first. The clock is as much of a relic
as the chair and sofa. But I&rsquo;ve got to mend my
glove again. It&rsquo;s ripped in the same place. Rotten
athletic goods they&rsquo;re selling nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a knock on the door, and Wallops,
the messenger, who stood revealed as the portal
was opened, announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="#image02">Mr. Zane would like to see you, Mr. Henderson.</a>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<a id="image02" name="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="384" height="600"
    alt="&ldquo;MR. ZANE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU, MR. HENDERSON.&rdquo;"
    title="&ldquo;MR. ZANE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU, MR. HENDERSON.&rdquo;" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;<a href="#Page_85">MR. ZANE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU, MR. HENDERSON.</a>&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; was the sententious answer.</p>

<p>Saying nothing further, the second baseman got
up, and, as the messenger went down the hall, he
followed slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in for it, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; remarked Tom
dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks so,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that item
in the paper, of course. Too bad it leaked out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what took place at the interview with the
proctor, Sid&rsquo;s chums did not learn until long afterward.
All that became known was that Dr.
Churchill was summoned, and that Sid was in the
proctor&rsquo;s study a long time. He returned to his
room a trifle pale, and with unnaturally bright
eyes. Throwing himself on the creaking sofa he
stared at the ceiling moodily, while Phil and Tom
maintained a discrete silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t some of you fellows say something?&rdquo;
burst out Sid finally. &ldquo;Think this is a
funeral?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think you wanted to have a talk-fest,&rdquo;
observed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in blazes am I to do?&rdquo; asked Sid desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; inquired Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know&mdash;Miss Harrison. I don&rsquo;t want to
have her think I&rsquo;m a gambler. I&rsquo;m not&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you tell her why you were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Dartwell the night of the raid?&rdquo; suggested the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; burst out Sid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what you mean!&rdquo; burst out Sid.
&ldquo;It looks as if I wasn&rsquo;t telling the truth. But I
am&mdash;you&rsquo;ll believe me&mdash;some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; advised Phil. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about
baseball. Have you seen the loving cup trophy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beaut!&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;I saw it in
the doctor&rsquo;s study. We&rsquo;re going to win it, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope so,&rdquo; murmured Phil. &ldquo;If we have a
few more games like to-day, we may. But speaking
of games&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
Sid started and leaped up from the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a message&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not finish, but Tom and Phil looked
significantly at each other. Clearly Sid expected
another mysterious summons. But, as he opened
the portal there stood the Jersey twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, fellows,&rdquo; began Joe, &ldquo;do you want to
see some sport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine sport,&rdquo; added Jerry, who sometimes
echoed his brother, a trick that was interchangeable
with the twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always ready for sport,&rdquo; replied Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
&ldquo;What is it: baiting a professor, or hazing some
freshies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; replied Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitchfork,&rdquo; echoed Jerry, that name, as I have
explained, being applied to Professor Emerson
Tines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s been particularly obnoxious of late,&rdquo;
went on Joe. &ldquo;Some of us had a little smoker the
other night, strictly sub-rosa, you understand, but
he smelled us out, and now some of us are doing
time for it. To-day Bricktop Molloy evolved a
little scheme, and we thought we&rsquo;d let you fellows
in on it. Want to come, Sid?&rdquo; for Sid had gone
back to the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not,&rdquo; he answered listlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;sick?&rdquo; inquired Joe, in a
whisper of Tom and Phil. They shook their
heads, and motioned to the twins not to make further
inquiries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get back at Pitchfork,&rdquo; went
on Jerry. &ldquo;Come along and you&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll just
explain, though, that he has quietly been &lsquo;tipped
off&rsquo; to the effect that another smoker is in progress,
and if he does as we expect him to, he&rsquo;ll try
to raid the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he does?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t find what he expects to. Come
on, and keep quiet. What&rsquo;s the matter with Sid,
anyhow?&rdquo; for by this time the four were out in
the corridor, leaving the moody one in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanged if we know,&rdquo; replied Phil, &ldquo;except
that there&rsquo;s a girl mixed up in it.&rdquo; He refrained
from saying anything about the accusation, thinking
that would be noised about soon enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s only a girl he&rsquo;ll soon be over it,&rdquo;
declared Joe with a professional air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; echoed his brother. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil and Tom soon found themselves in the
midst of a number of choice spirits, who moved
silently about the lower end of the corridor, near
a room that was sometimes used for student meetings,
and where, more than once, it was whispered,
smokers had been held, in violation of the rules.
The reason for the selection of this apartment was
that it had an open fireplace, which carried off the
fumes of the tobacco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he get the tip?&rdquo; asked Jerry, as he and
his brother, together with Phil and Tom, came
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sure did,&rdquo; answered Bricktop. &ldquo;Reports
from the front are that he is on the warpath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is everything working all right?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine. Can&rsquo;t you smell it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Phil sniffed the air. There was an
unmistakable odor of tobacco.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s a smoker going on in there, why
was Pitchfork tipped off?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll see, me lad,&rdquo; advised Bricktop
in his rich brogue. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s coming now.
Pump her up, Kindlings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, for the first time Tom and his chum
noticed that Dan Woodhouse had a small air
pump, which he was vigorously working, as he
stood in a dark corner.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded down the corridor. There
were hasty cautions from the ringleaders, and the
lads hid themselves in the dim shadows of the
big hall. The footsteps came nearer, and then
they seemed to cease. But the reason was soon
apparent, for Professor Emerson Tines was now
tip-toeing his way toward the door of the suspected
room. By the dim light of a half-turned down
gas jet he could be seen sneaking up. The only
sound from the students was the faint sound of
the air pump. Tom and Phil could not imagine
what it was for.</p>

<p>Professor Tines reached the portal. Then he
gave a sudden knock, and called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I demand to be admitted at once, young gentlemen!
I know the nefarious practice that is
going on in there, and it must stop at once! Open
the door or I shall summon the janitor and have
it forced! Open at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor tried the knob. To his surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it at once opened the door, and he almost stumbled
into the apartment. He uttered an exclamation
of delight, probably in the belief that he had
caught the students red-handed, but the next moment
he gave a gasp of dismay.</p>

<p>For, as Tom, Phil, and all the others could see
from their vantage points in the shadowy recesses,
the room was empty. It was lighted, however,
and in plain view on a table in the middle of the
floor was a large flask. In the top of this there
was a receptacle which contained a pile of burning
tobacco, and it was glowing as though some
giant was puffing on the improvised pipe. From
a glass tube extending from the flask there poured
out volumes of the pungent odor, and, as the
puffs came, Tom and Phil could hear the air pump
being worked. It was a &ldquo;studentless smoker,&rdquo; the
air pump, attached to a rubber hose which exhausted
the air from the flask, producing exactly
the effect of some one puffing a pipe. The room
was blue with the haze of tobacco, and as the
astonished professor stood and gazed at the
strange sight more smoke arose from the flask.
Then, from somewhere in the dark recesses of the
corridor came a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stung!&rdquo; it ejaculated, and there was a hurried
movement as the students fled in the darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>THE ENVELOPE</h3>


<p>Plunging on through the darkened corridors
Tom and Phil reached their room. They found
Sid still on the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that was great!&rdquo; cried Tom, venturing
to laugh, now that there was no danger of being
caught. &ldquo;You should have been along, Sid. Pitchfork
got his to-night, all right. I&rsquo;ll never forget
the blank look on his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I either,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;That was a smoker
as was a smoker. I hope none of us are caught.
The twins and Bricktop outdid themselves this
trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid began to show some signs of interest, and
the trick was told of in detail to him. Of course
a faculty inquiry followed, but the hose and air
pump had been taken from the school laboratory,
and there were no clues to the perpetrators. Professor
Tines was furious, and demanded that the
guilty ones be dismissed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly, my dear professor,&rdquo; agreed the venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Dr. Churchill, &ldquo;if I can only find them,&rdquo;
and there was a twinkle in his deep-set eyes, which
he took care that Mr. Tines did not see.</p>

<p>Baseball practice went on for several days.
One afternoon, as the lads were dispersing, Ed
Kerr was seen coming over the diamond, holding
in his hand a letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t play Fairview Saturday,&rdquo; he announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say they&rsquo;re not quite ready to open their
season,&rdquo; went on the manager. &ldquo;They ask me to
put the opening game off a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to do it?&rdquo; inquired several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you fellows say?&rdquo; asked the
manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, they probably have a good reason.
We&rsquo;ll let it go a week,&rdquo; assented Tom. &ldquo;But can
we get another game in place of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can fill in with the Layton Preparatory
school for this Saturday, and we can go to Wescott
University the following Saturday, and then
tackle Fairview, if you fellows say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>

<p>When Tom and Phil returned to their room
Sid was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it, anyhow, Phil?&rdquo;
asked the pitcher, and there was no need to be
more explicit.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all, I don&rsquo;t know. It looks funny;
about Sid not wanting to tell. And he sure is cut
up over Miss Harrison. I wonder who sent her
that newspaper clipping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up. But I heard that there was a raid
all right, and a lot of college fellows were caught.
Some of &rsquo;em were our chaps, but they managed
to keep their identity hidden. I don&rsquo;t see how
Sid&rsquo;s got out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you think he was there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. But it looks mighty
funny. I do hope he isn&rsquo;t going to cut loose, just
at the opening of the ball season,&rdquo; and Tom
sighed, as though he had the weight of worlds
on his shoulders. And, indeed it is no small task
to be captain of a lively college team, struggling
to win the championship trophy, and the pitcher
was beginning to realize this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe he just wanted a fling,&rdquo; suggested
Phil. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s had it he&rsquo;s ashamed to admit
it, and wants to cover it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he denies that he was caught,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it; but what good will that do him, if
he doesn&rsquo;t tell where he was that night? He admits
that he was in Dartwell, and he must have
been somewhere near the place of the raid, or his
name would never have gotten in the papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless some one gave his name out of spite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By hookey! That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; admitted Phil. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
never thought of that. But no&mdash;no college fellow
would be as mean as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless it was Langridge or Gerhart. Gerhart
is in parts unknown, and Langridge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand none of the Boxer Hall fellows
were in it,&rdquo; went on Phil. &ldquo;Only some of our
boys and a few from Fairview&mdash;more fools they!
But it sure has put Sid on the blink as far as Miss
Harrison goes. Ruth was telling me her family,
as well as she, has a horror of gambling in any
form. Poor old Sid. I wish we could help him;
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure do,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;We need him on
the nine, and we need him in good condition.
First thing I know I&rsquo;ll have to put a sub on in
Sid&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not. But, say, I&rsquo;ve got to do some
studying if I&rsquo;m to play on the team myself. I&rsquo;m
getting to low water mark in Latin and maths.
Here goes for some hard boning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was about a week after this, in which time
Randall had met, and beaten, Layton Preparatory
school, that Phil, Sid and Tom were taking a
trolley ride one evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the Tonoka Lake car,&rdquo; suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means let&rsquo;s go to Fairview,&rdquo; asserted
Phil. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; Sid said nothing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course it was only a coincidence, but a little
later the three lads were walking down toward
the co-educational institution, and of course, I suppose,
it was also only a coincidence that Miss
Tyler and Miss Clinton should shortly come
strolling over the campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Ruth,&rdquo; announced Phil carelessly,
though he was not looking at her, but at Miss
Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied Tom, as if it was the
queerest thing in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re headed this way&mdash;no use to turn back,
I suppose?&rdquo; asked Phil, as if there was some
doubt of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Besides, I want to ask
your sister what she thinks of the chances of
Fairview beating us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll tell you her college will win, of
course,&rdquo; asserted Phil. &ldquo;Well, come on,&rdquo; and
they walked to meet the girls who had pretended
not to notice the approach of the lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why hello, Phil!&rdquo; called his sister. &ldquo;Glad
to see you; aren&rsquo;t we, Madge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Miss Tyler, with a merry
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you fellows later,&rdquo; murmured Sid, who
was very sensitive, and he was about to swing
away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; urged Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be going
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sid turned aside. As he did so there came
around the corner of the main college building
two figures, who strolled over the campus. It
needed but a glance to disclose to Tom and Phil
who they were&mdash;Miss Harrison and Fred Langridge.
The couple were chatting and laughing
merrily. Instinctively Tom turned to see if Sid
had observed them. The second baseman had,
and, for an instant he stood staring after the two,
who had not seen him. Then, without a word,
he kept on his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful evening,&rdquo; remarked Miss Tyler
quickly, and she began to talk rapidly about the
weather, as if to cover Sid&rsquo;s retreat.</p>

<p>As Tom and Phil walked along the corridor
leading to their room a little later that night, they
saw a light streaming out of the cracks around the
portal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Phil, &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But he
did not finish the sentence. Awkwardly he and
Tom pushed in. They started back at the sight
of their chum.</p>

<p>He was bending over a table on which he had
placed a portable electric lamp, the college rooms
being illuminated with both gas and the incandescents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Holding a paper in the glow of the bulb,
Sid was examining the document with the aid of
a magnifying glass. At the same time he seemed
to be comparing other pieces of paper with the
one he held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studying?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Sid shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something new?&rdquo; inquired Phil. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you were qualifying for a course in identifying
handwriting,&rdquo; for he saw that the papers
Sid was looking at contained writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see this?&rdquo; asked Sid suddenly, holding
up an envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s addressed
to Miss Harrison, and&mdash;but&mdash;are you
going over with a microscope a letter you&rsquo;ve written
to her, to see if it will pass muster? She&rsquo;s
not as particular as that, you old bat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been writing to her,&rdquo; replied Sid
coldly. &ldquo;This is the envelope containing that clipping
with my name in it&mdash;the report of the gambling
raid&mdash;I picked up the envelope&mdash;that afternoon,&rdquo;
and he seemed struggling with some emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; asked Phil, who did not exactly
catch the drift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; answered Sid quickly. &ldquo;Look at this
note,&rdquo; and he showed them a missive containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
some reference to baseball matters. It was signed
&ldquo;Fred Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got that from Langridge last term,&rdquo; went
on Sid, &ldquo;and I saved it, for some unknown reason.
I&rsquo;m glad, now, that I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Tom, who began to see what
was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, look at that!&rdquo; and Sid placed side by
side the note from Langridge and the envelope
that had contained the damaging clipping. He
held the magnifying glass first over one and then
the other. &ldquo;Do you notice any similarity?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as if the same person wrote
both,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did!&rdquo; cried Sid, as he held up the envelope.
&ldquo;Fred Langridge sent to Miss Harrison
that lying clipping about me, and to-day he was
out walking with her!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>A CLASH</h3>


<p>Sid stood facing his two chums, and his breath
came quick and fast. He was much worked up
over his discovery, as were also his roommates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the time I picked up this envelope,
after that day when we had lunch with your sister,
Phil,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to think
in whose handwriting it was. Perhaps I had no
right to take the envelope, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it
after she&mdash;Miss Harrison dropped it. To-night,
after I saw him&mdash;saw Langridge out walking with
her&mdash;I came back here, and I had a suspicion. I
knew I had an old note of Langridge&rsquo;s somewhere
around. I found it, and compared it with the
envelope. You see what it shows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have sent her the clipping,&rdquo; agreed
Tom. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy enough to see that,&rdquo; answered Sid. &ldquo;He
was mad because I&mdash;er&mdash;I happened to go with
her a few times, and he is taking this course to
give me a bad name, though if she only knew it
Langridge is no white-ribboner.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe that was a fake clipping,&rdquo; suggested
Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of such things being done before.
Langridge might have hired a printer to
set that item up so that it looked as if it was cut
from a newspaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Sid quietly. &ldquo;The item was
genuine. I have a similar one I cut from the Haddonfield
<i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that is&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t say anything about
it,&rdquo; and Sid looked miserable again. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
glad I found out who sent it to Miss Harrison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have it out with Langridge the
first time I meet him. I&rsquo;ll punch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better go slow,&rdquo; advised Phil. &ldquo;Take it easy,
old man. Langridge is a slick article. We know
that of old. If you try a rough-house he&rsquo;ll have
you at a disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m not going to let him get
ahead of me this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it and play ball,&rdquo; advised Tom
with a laugh, for he felt that the subject was getting
too serious, and his heart was wrapped up in
his team, despite a certain pretty girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish I could&mdash;forget it,&rdquo; answered Sid.</p>

<p>It was several days after this, and a few days
before the game with Wescott University, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was to be played on the latter club&rsquo;s grounds, that
Phil, Tom and Sid journeyed to the town of Haddonfield
to get some things to take with them on
the trip. For it was quite a journey to play Wescott,
a college with whom Randall had clashed in
football, losing the game because Phil was taken
sick and a new quarter back had to go in. It took
a day to go and a day to come, and the lads
would need to take some baggage with them.</p>

<p>The three chums had made their purchases,
and were on their way to take a car back to Randall,
when Sid grasped the arm of Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Tom, who was critically examining
a new tie he had purchased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have
it out with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; begged Phil, but it was too late, for
Sid had crossed the street to where the former
pitcher for Randall was walking with another
chap, as sportily attired as was he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you!&rdquo; called Sid to his
enemy, as he came up behind him, Tom and Phil
following at a distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; drawled Langridge, turning.
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it Henderson? Well, I don&rsquo;t
know that I care to talk to you. I&rsquo;m not used to
associating with chaps caught in gambling raids!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid was fairly trembling with rage, but he managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to take from his pocket a duplicate of the
clipping which Miss Harrison had received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you send that to her?&rdquo; spluttered
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send it to whom?&rdquo; asked Langridge insolently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Harrison? That lying clipping about
me? Did you send it, I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, supposing I did? It&rsquo;s a free country;
isn&rsquo;t it? Besides, I&rsquo;m not so sure that the clipping
doesn&rsquo;t tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you sent it!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
dare deny it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare you deny that you are the person referred
to in it? Dare you deny that you were in
that gambling hall the night of the raid? Dare
you deny that?&rdquo; fired back Langridge.</p>

<p>Sid seemed stunned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;how&mdash;how did you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he was
stammering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t dare deny it,&rdquo; went on Langridge
with a sneer. &ldquo;Your manner is answer
enough. Come on, Perkins. I don&rsquo;t care to prolong
this discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do!&rdquo; cried poor Sid, now beside himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you for this dirty, sneaking
piece of work! You dare send that clipping
to her&mdash;to her! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he sprang forward,
with clenched fists, and before Tom or Phil could
stop him, he had struck Langridge. The latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with a snarl of rage, jumped toward Sid, but his
friend clasped his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here! Not here!&rdquo; implored Perkins.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fight here, Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted the other with a
shrug of his shoulders, as he calmed himself with
an effort. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know that I care, after
all, for the notoriety of fighting him.&rdquo; He turned
aside. Sid was about to spring forward again,
his face distorted with rage, but Tom and Phil
held him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; whispered the pitcher in his ear.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, Sid. You&rsquo;re
only making matters worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With something like a sob in his throat, Sid
allowed his chums to lead him away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>SID IS SPIKED</h3>


<p>&ldquo;By Jove, but I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re going out of
town for a game,&rdquo; remarked Tom to Phil the
next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired the first baseman, as he critically
examined his favorite mushroom bat, which
he had mended with wire and tape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of Sid. It may put him on his feet
again, after this business of Langridge, Miss
Harrison, and the newspaper clipping. Hang it
all! girls can sure mix things up when they want
to, can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it isn&rsquo;t her fault. She merely doesn&rsquo;t
care for a fellow that gambles, and Sid can&rsquo;t say
that he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Sid gambles,&rdquo; said Tom
quickly. &ldquo;I was going to add,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;d &lsquo;gamble&rsquo; on that. After the way he acted
with Langridge last night, almost coming to a
fight, I think there is something more in this than
we&rsquo;ve thought of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably there is; but why doesn&rsquo;t Sid come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
out and say he wasn&rsquo;t in the raid, and clear himself?
It ought to be easy enough to do, but he
doesn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know; and yet he may have a reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely. But things look suspicious. Mind
you, I don&rsquo;t say to us, for I&rsquo;d stick to Sid, no
matter what he did. But there&rsquo;s the fact of him
suddenly being broke, being out late several times,
going off after getting mysterious notes, and
coming in smelling strongly of tobacco. It looks
bad, and I don&rsquo;t see why Sid doesn&rsquo;t own up and
confess, or else clear himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he can&rsquo;t. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor
there. I&rsquo;m glad he and Langridge didn&rsquo;t fight.
Now we&rsquo;re going out of town to play Wescott,
and maybe get beaten, for they have a fine nine.
But, anyhow, it will do Sid good. He may come
back entirely different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, for there&rsquo;s no fun living with
him, as he is now. I was glad when he got so
infatuated with Miss Harrison, even going to
the length of taking up hammered brass work because
she had a fad that way. But since she
turned him down poor Sid chucked all his brass
stuff out of the window the other day. Well,
maybe it will come out all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to,&rdquo; declared Tom fiercely. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m going down to see Kerr and Leighton, to
learn if everything&rsquo;s all ready for the trip.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day the team started for Wescott
University, accompanied by as many of the students
as could cut their lectures. It was a day&rsquo;s
trip to the big college, one day would be devoted
to the game, which was an annual affair,
and the return trip would be made the third day.</p>

<p>The Randallites were accorded an enthusiastic
welcome as they were escorted to their hotel by
the Wescott lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember how sick I was when we were here
last year to play &rsquo;em football?&rdquo; asked Phil, as
he and his chums went to their rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure do. Please don&rsquo;t repeat the experience.
We want to beat these fellows if we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning of the game did not prove very
auspicious, as it had rained in the night, and was
still threatening. But when the two nines went
out to the diamond the sun broke through the
clouds and it cleared off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows,&rdquo; said Coach Leighton, as he
gathered the captain and his men about him,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to play fast, snappy ball to win.
We&rsquo;re up against a better team than either Boxer
Hall or Fairview, and I want to see what you
can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t do what&rsquo;s right they&rsquo;ll answer
to me,&rdquo; said Tom, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you fellows lose you&rsquo;ll have to walk
home,&rdquo; added Manager Kerr.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, then we&rsquo;ll not allow &rsquo;em a hit,&rdquo; prophesied
Bricktop Molloy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll whitewash &rsquo;em,&rdquo; added Dutch Housenlager,
as he tried to trip up Joe Jackson, but
failed.</p>

<p>It was a fast, snappy game from the very start,
Tom doing some superb work in the box, but
being fully matched by Marshall, the Wescott
twirler, who was &ldquo;a southpaw,&rdquo; or left hander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly&rsquo;s hard to hit,&rdquo; conceded Holly
Cross, when the Randallites came to bat in the
fifth inning, with never a run scored, while Wescott
had two, one each having been garnered in
the second and third innings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to have some left-handed batters to
sort of fool him,&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can bat left handed,&rdquo; said Sid, who had been
unusually quiet during the trip and the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out! Then it&rsquo;s something new!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Sid, &ldquo;and yet it isn&rsquo;t either. I
used to bat left handed before I came to Randall,
but I gave it up. I&rsquo;ve been practicing it on the
quiet, lately, and if you like I&rsquo;ll try it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s risky,&rdquo; objected Tom. &ldquo;Wait until we
see what we can do this inning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they couldn&rsquo;t do anything, and after three
men had gone down, one after the other, under
the scientific twirling of Marshall, Mr. Leighton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Kerr and Tom, after a consultation decided to
let Sid try, as he was to bat first in the next round.</p>

<p>Wescott managed to get two more runs, as
the players were &ldquo;finding&rdquo; Tom, and things began
to look black for the visiting team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See if you can&rsquo;t rap out a home run,&rdquo; begged
the captain, as Sid went to the plate in the sixth.
There was manifest surprise when he took the
left-handed position, and Marshall and Bradshaw,
the latter being the Wescott catcher, held a whispered
consultation.</p>

<p>Whatever line of play they decided on availed
them nothing, however, for Sid caught a &ldquo;beaut&rdquo;
on the end of his bat, selecting the first ball
pitched, and he sent it away over in the right
field bleachers, easily making a three-bagger of
it. He could have come on home, except for
ground rules, which allowed only three bases on
a ball that went among the spectators, of whom
there was an enormous crowd present, almost up
to the base lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; delightedly cried the Randall supporters,
and the record was soon bettered for
Holly Cross came up next, and, though he batted
right handed, he managed to whale out a two-bagger,
which brought in Sid and made the first
tally for the visitors. That gave them confidence
and they made three runs that inning, coming
within one of tying the score.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom, too, seemed to stiffen in his work, and he
struck out three men in quick succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now if we can only do as well this inning,&rdquo;
remarked the coach, as Dutch Housenlager came
up. Dutch knocked a pretty fly, and was off like
the wind to first. He never would have reached
it, but for an error on the part of the right fielder
who muffed the ball, amid the groans of his fellows.
Then, for a time, the Wescott team
seemed to go to pieces, until, when the eighth inning
opened, the score was tied.</p>

<p>Goose eggs were chalked up in the frames of
both teams in the eighth, however, the pitchers
both working hard. Then came Randall&rsquo;s chance
at the bat in the ninth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One run will beat &rsquo;em, if we can only hold &rsquo;em
down when they come up,&rdquo; muttered Kerr to
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my part,&rdquo; the nervy pitcher assured
him.</p>

<p>It fell to Sid again, to do the trick. There
were two men out, when he came up, and it looked
hopeless, but he again batted left handed, and
once more caught a &ldquo;beaut&rdquo; on the end of his
bat. He got two bases on it, and, by great good
luck Holly Cross, next player, whaled out what
proved to be a triple, and Sid, as soon as he heard
the crack of the ball, started home.</p>

<p>As he swung around toward third base the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
player there perhaps unintentionally got in his
way. The baseman pretended that the ball was
being fielded to him, in his endeavor to throw
Sid out of his calculations, but the nervy Randall
second baseman kept on. There was a collision
between him and the man covering the bag, and,
for an instant, Sid hesitated on third, and almost
fell over, seizing his left foot in both hands, and
hopping about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid&rsquo;s spiked!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;The third baseman
spiked him, just as he had a chance to score!
Come on in, Sid. Come on in!&rdquo; yelled the captain
frantically.</p>

<p>There was a confusing chorus of yells, so much
so that the fielder after the ball, which had gone
past him, did not know what to do, after he had
the horsehide. But by this time Sid was limping
toward home, running fairly well, but with a look
of agony on his face. Holly Cross was racing
from second now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home with that ball, you loon!&rdquo; yelled the
Wescott catcher, who saw Sid coming, for the
Wescott fielder was stupidly holding it.</p>

<p>Then the fielder woke up, and threw to second,
hoping to catch out Holly, who was somewhat
undecided. But Sid kept on to home, and tallied
the run, though he almost collapsed a moment
later, while Holly leaped on to third.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt bad?&rdquo; asked Tom, as he and several
others hurried up to Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Leighton, as
he saw the blood running from Sid&rsquo;s shoe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Holly had reached third, though
the decision was close. He died there, for the
next man struck out, retiring the side, and making
the score five to four, in favor of Randall, though
with Wescott still to have a chance in the ending
of the ninth.</p>

<p>The third baseman made all sorts of apologies
to Sid, who indeed had a nasty cut, for a spike had
gone through the outer, fleshy part of his foot.
It was so evidently an accident, however, that
nothing unpleasant was said, though Sid could
not play, and had to be replaced by Pete Backus.</p>

<p>There was a grim look on Tom&rsquo;s face as he
took his place in the box, and it was justified, for
he struck out two men. The third knocked what
seemed was going to be a nice hit, but Pete Backus
caught it, though he had to jump well for it, a
feat for which his training stood him well in
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! We&rsquo;ve done &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Tom, when
he realized that the third Wescott man was out,
without a run having been scored by their rivals
in the last inning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure have,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Leighton. &ldquo;Poor
Sid, though. He&rsquo;ll be out of it for a few days.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, as long as we won the game,&rdquo;
spoke the plucky lad, as he limped along, his foot
having been dressed, and peroxide applied, to
prevent blood poisoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a glorious victory,&rdquo; sang Holly Cross,
the others joining in, after cheers had been given
for Wescott, and returned by those fine-spirited
lads.</p>

<p>It was a jolly crowd that journeyed back to
Randall next day, with the Wescott scalps hanging
at their belts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just what Sid wanted,&rdquo; decided Tom
to Phil as he noted the lively look on the second
baseman&rsquo;s face, for he was jolly and laughing, in
spite of the pain of his injured foot.</p>

<p>There was a great celebration in Randall when
the victorious team marched up the campus that
night, and bonfires galore glared all around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A feast to-night,&rdquo; decided a crowd of the
team&rsquo;s most enthusiastic supporters. &ldquo;Sid Henderson
will be toastmaster, on account of his
great work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sid, who had limped to his room to change
his clothes, shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Tom and Phil in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to go away to-night,&rdquo;
and Sid tried to conceal a letter in his hand&mdash;a
letter which he had found awaiting him when
he returned from Wescott with his chums.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3>A JOKE ON THE PROCTOR</h3>


<p>For a moment neither Tom nor Phil answered.
There was an embarrassed silence, but it only
affected the three chums, for all about them was
a rollicking, shouting crowd of students intent on
arranging for a celebration in honor of the nine,
and Sid&mdash;the player who had done so much to
help win.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you <i>got</i> to go?&rdquo; asked Tom, in a low
voice. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you put it off, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go. I can&rsquo;t put it off,&rdquo; was the
reply, as Sid turned and limped away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say! Where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo; demanded
Snail Looper. &ldquo;We want to form a procession
and carry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be back&mdash;later,&rdquo; answered Phil, for
both he and Tom wished to conceal, as long as
possible, the growing mystery that seemed to be
enveloping their chum.</p>

<p>There was no time for longer talk with Sid, as
he had hurried off as fast as his injured foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
would let him, though Mr. Leighton had advised
him to stay in his room for a couple of days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s going?&rdquo; asked Tom
of Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up, unless he&rsquo;s going to call on Miss
Harrison, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem very likely. He&rsquo;d
be more cheerful if it was that. As it is he acts as
if he was going to a funeral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He got another one of those
queer letters, and, as usual, when he does, he
scoots off somewhere. Do you know what I
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think of so many things, Tom, I can&rsquo;t
be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No joking. I mean we ought to follow him,
and see where he goes so mysteriously. Maybe
we could help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we couldn&rsquo;t do that, but I&rsquo;d do anything
else to help Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to play the
spy; but, just the same, I wish I knew what was
worrying him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later the two players were caught
up in a rush of enthusiastic students that involved
the whole nine except Sid, and were carried off
to an impromptu celebration. Bonfires were blazing,
and hastily-organized banquets were in order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d won the championship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to see the way they take on,&rdquo; remarked Holly
Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in line for it, after the way we
beat Wescott,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best nine
Randall has had in many a year, if I do say it
myself,&rdquo; and Tom looked proudly on his team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smother him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into the lake with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him eat soft soap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choke him with a double ice-cream cone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cries, and many more, greeted the almost
fatal announcement of Ford Fenton. Much
abashed, he turned aside from the crowd into
which he had made his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that, if I were you,&rdquo; remarked
Bert Bascome to him. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
go back at &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Ford hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have been manager of the team if some
of the mollycoddles around here had had any
spunk,&rdquo; went on the sporty freshman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
done yet, either. I&rsquo;ll make the team wish, before
the season is over, that Ed Kerr hadn&rsquo;t been
manager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not do anything rash, will you?&rdquo; asked
Ford, who was somewhat afraid of his wealthy
chum, who proposed daring pranks sometimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Bascome with a superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
air. &ldquo;If I had some one to help me I know
what I&rsquo;d do. Come over here, I want to talk to
you,&rdquo; and he led Ford off to where a number of
freshmen of Bascome&rsquo;s crowd were looking on
at the celebration in honor of the nine, but taking
no part. Tom saw Ford going off with Bascome,
the enthusiastic welcome of the players having
calmed down for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; he observed to Phil. &ldquo;Bascome
is a chap likely to get Ford into trouble.
There&rsquo;s a fast set in the freshie crowd this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we didn&rsquo;t take enough temper out of
&rsquo;em with the hazing last fall. Have to do the
job over again, I guess. But come on, enjoy life
while you can,&rdquo; and the two were once more
caught up in the happy rush.</p>

<p>The celebration went on the better part of
the evening, and when Phil and Tom got to their
room Sid was not there. He came in later, narrowly
missing detection by the proctor, and said
little. He was limping quite badly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the foot?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much better,&rdquo; answered Sid. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
have gone out to-night, only&mdash;I had to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was dead lame the next day, and for two
days after that had to stay in bed, his place on
the nine, in practice games, being taken by Pete
Backus, who did not do half badly.</p>

<p>The game with Fairview was approaching and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it was likely to be a severely-contested one. Tom
was a little anxious but seemed more at ease when
Dr. Marshall, the college physician, gave it as
his opinion that Sid could play, his foot having
almost healed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got to bat as you did before too,
old sport,&rdquo; insisted Tom, with a laugh. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you spring that left-hand racket before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I wasn&rsquo;t at all sure of it. When
I was a kid I always batted left handed. Then I
broke my shoulder and I had to bat right handed
after it mended, for it was stiff. Then later I
found I could bat either way, but I favored right,
until lately, when I began practicing left again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep you for a pinch hitter,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;I must revise the batting order, and get
you up first, after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid got into practice a few days before the
Fairview game, but was so stiff that it was decided
to have some one run for him, after he had gotten
to first.</p>

<p>The day before the game, when Sid, Phil and
Tom were in their room, Sid putting some strips
of adhesive plaster on his lame foot, there came a
cautious knock at the door. Dutch Housenlager
was at once admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you fellows game?&rdquo; was his first question.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a joke on Proc. Zane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re always ready for that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sid. &ldquo;He has caught me once this term, and
nearly twice. What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain,&rdquo; went on Dutch, fairly bubbling
over with mirth. &ldquo;Only you fellows may have to
stand for part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our share,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to use one of your windows for part
of the trick. May we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; answered Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stand for anything
short of setting fire to the college, and we&rsquo;ll
throw in a hazing of Pitchfork if it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll get his some day,&rdquo; replied Dutch,
&ldquo;but just now we&rsquo;re after Zane. Here&rsquo;s a cord.
When you hear three tree-toad whistles down below,
lower it from your window, and then at two
tugs haul up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to pull the proctor up here,
are you?&rdquo; inquired Phil in some alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I wish we could. He&rsquo;s been on the
job pretty brisk, lately. Just haul the cord, and
then I&rsquo;ll be back to explain more,&rdquo; and leaving
a stout string in Tom&rsquo;s hands Dutch hurried
away. The three chums tried to guess what was
to follow, and made all sorts of wild hazards, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the midst of which they were interrupted by hearing
from below the cautious imitation of the trill
of a tree-toad, thrice repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lower the cord,&rdquo; whispered Phil, and Tom
dangled it from the window. In a few minutes he
felt two tugs, which was the signal for hauling up,
and he pulled until he had hoisted to his window
sill a coil of strong wire. The inseparables were
wondering what it was for, when Dutch reappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything heavy we can fasten this to?&rdquo; he
asked, as his eyes roved about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the alarm clock,&rdquo; replied Sid. &ldquo;It
wakes us out of a heavy sleep, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rotten joke,&rdquo; commented Dutch. &ldquo;Here, this
will do,&rdquo; and he approached the old sofa, holding
the coil of wire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t damage it; will it?&rdquo; cried Phil in
some alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible, son! Impossible!&rdquo; replied Dutch.
&ldquo;I only want to anchor the wire to the sofa.
There we are,&rdquo; and he rapidly made a loop in
the wire, and strung it around the ancient piece
of furniture. Then the other end of the wire was
dangled out of the window. It was promptly
pulled taut, and seemed to be stretched out for
some distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; commented Dutch. &ldquo;Holly
and the rest of the boys are on the job.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Tom,
much mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon see,&rdquo; answered Dutch, as he hurried
from the room again.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3>PLANNING A PICNIC</h3>


<p>When Dutch returned, after an absence of
about half an hour, he seemed in considerable of
a hurry. He went directly to the window, out of
which there stretched away in the darkness the
tight wire, and from the casement dropped a cord.
Then he gave a whistling signal, which was answered.
Dutch began to haul up on the cord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, look here!&rdquo; burst out Phil. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up,
anyhow? Let us in on the joke, as long as you&rsquo;re
using our room to work it from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Dutch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ready now,
as soon as I get the cord Snail Looper is fastening
to this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hauled up a thin but strong rope, and once
more gave some whistling signals. Then he closed
down the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have to wait about an hour,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s up. You know
the proctor has been unusually officious of late,
and several of us have suffered.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid nodded appreciatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Dutch, &ldquo;some of us have
rigged up an effigy, in the shape of a student in a
dress suit, and at this moment the said imitation
student is strung on this wire, which extends from
your window across the campus, to the clump of
elms just beyond Booker Memorial chapel. The
effigy is a sort of trolley car, and this is the wire.
This cord, which I just hauled up is also attached
to the figure. Now at the proper time, when
Proc. Zane goes out to catch some poor chap,
who has been off to see his best girl, and has
stayed too late, I&rsquo;ll pull this string, the figure will
slide along the wire, with the feet just touching
the ground, and the proctor thinking it is a student,
will rush up to identify him. There will be
something interesting when the two meet,&rdquo; and
Dutch began to chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can we see it?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as
dark as a pocket to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the better. The fellows hidden in the
clump of elms have an automobile search light,
which they will turn on at the proper moment.
Do you catch on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! It&rsquo;s rich!&rdquo; cried Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All to the mustard and the spoon, too!&rdquo; decided
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lallapaloosa!&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not a bit of danger,&rdquo; added Dutch. &ldquo;As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
soon as the search light flashes on the scene, and
the proctor is made aware of the joke, I&rsquo;ll cut
the wire from your window, it will fall to the
ground, be hauled in by the fellows in the elms,
together with the figure, and not a bit of evidence
will remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; commented Tom. &ldquo;But how can you
be sure that the proctor will be out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve arranged for that. Snail and Holly
took pains to converse, rather loudly, in Mr.
Zane&rsquo;s hearing to-night, though they pretended
not to see him. They intimated that they might
try to sneak in about eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the trick comes off then?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. We&rsquo;ve got half an hour yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students sat and talked of many things
while waiting, chiefly baseball, until a slight vibration
of the wire and a tug of the cord warned
them that the time for action had arrived. Dutch
explained that he had arranged a code of signals
with his chums so that he knew when to haul in
on the cord which would pull the stuffed figure
along the wire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo; he whispered finally. &ldquo;Now
watch the fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to haul, and the sagging of the wire
told of a weight on it. Listening, as they peered
from the window into the darkness, Tom and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
friends could hear some one running across the
campus. Then came a challenge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, if you please, sir! I see you, and it is
useless to try and sneak into college at this hour!
I demand your name, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Zane!&rdquo; whispered Phil.</p>

<p>A moment later the wire was violently agitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s caught him!&rdquo; exclaimed Dutch. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t they turn on the light, so he can see it&rsquo;s only
a stuffed scarecrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that instant a dazzling pencil of light cut
the air, wavered around uncertainly, and then
was focused on a queer sight. The dignified
proctor of Randall College held in his embrace
the swaying figure of an effigy, attired in full
evening dress, but with a caricature of a face.
The image swayed from the overhead wire, and
the proctor cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is disgraceful, sir! I believe you are intoxicated!
You will be expelled for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as the light suddenly became brighter the
official was made aware that what he had grasped
was only rags and straw in a dress suit. So
bright was the light that the amazed anger on the
proctor&rsquo;s face was plainly depicted. Suddenly
Mr. Zane leaped back from the image, looked
up and saw the wire, and darted for the clump of
elms, toward which it extended.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they turn off that light?&rdquo; demanded
Dutch, anxiously, and, as though in answer, it
went out. Hurriedly he cut the wire, and closed
the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It worked like a charm,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s
the word now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What happened outside in the darkness Tom
and his chums could not see, but later they learned
that the image and wire was safely hauled out
of sight, and the students escaped from the group
of trees before the proctor got there. Of course
he made diligent efforts to find out who had
played the trick, but it was useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That puts us in good humor for the game
to-morrow,&rdquo; observed Tom, as, chuckling, he and
his chums went to bed. But if they had known
what was in store for them on the morrow, they
would not have slept so peacefully.</p>

<p>For they suffered a severe drubbing at the hands
of Fairview Institute when they met that nine on
the diamond the next afternoon. How it happened
they did not like to think of afterward, but
it was mainly due to poor fielding. Tom pitched
well, and Sid made some good hits, but his foot
went back on him, even in the short spurt to
first. Then, too, Dutch and Holly, usually to be
depended on, disgraced themselves by making
almost inexcusable errors.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was Fairview&rsquo;s playing anything to boast
of, aside from the work of the battery. It was
just one of those occasions when both teams seem
to go stale, and probably on the part of Randall
the prank of the night before, which kept several
members of the team up late, had not a little to
do with it. Sufficient to say, that though Tom
managed to whip his men into some kind of shape
for the last three innings it was too late, and they
went down to defeat by a score of 3 to 10.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the girls watching us, too!&rdquo; groaned Phil,
as they were changing their clothes after the
game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to see them when we get
washed up?&rdquo; asked Sid eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel much like it,&rdquo; grumbled Tom,
but, somehow, he and Phil did manage to gravitate
to where Madge Tyler and Ruth Clinton
were standing. Sid followed at a discreet distance,
but when he saw Miss Harrison strolling
about the grounds with Langridge, the second
baseman took a trolley car for home.</p>

<p>Tom and Sid had to stand considerable chaffing
on the part of their two pretty companions, but
they didn&rsquo;t mind so much, and Tom declared that
his team was only practicing, and would eventually
win the championship, and the gold loving
cup.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; remarked Phil, at parting,
&ldquo;Ruth, don&rsquo;t you and Miss Tyler want to come
to our doings next week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What doings?&rdquo; asked his sister. &ldquo;See you
defeated at baseball again, or go to a fraternity
dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something on the order of the latter,&rdquo; replied
her brother, making a wry face. &ldquo;The sophs are
going to have a little picnic on Crest Island, in
Tonoka Lake, next Wednesday, and it will be one
swell affair. Regular old-fashioned picnic&mdash;basket
lunches, ants in the butter, snakes under the leaves,
and all that. Holly Cross thought it up, and it&rsquo;s
great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful brain he must have,&rdquo; said
Miss Tyler, with a delicious laugh. &ldquo;But it
sounds nice. What do you say, Ruth? Shall we
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, if you will. But&mdash;er&mdash;Mabel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She looked questioningly toward her chum, who
was strolling with Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bring her along,&rdquo; invited Phil. &ldquo;This is
an old-fashioned affair, and no special person will
bring any one else. Tom and Sid and I will
look after you girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Phil, you forget that Mr. Henderson and
Mabel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all, don&rsquo;t let that matter,&rdquo; spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Phil. &ldquo;I dare say Sid won&rsquo;t be around. As soon
as he gets in the woods or fields he&rsquo;s always after
bugs or animals&mdash;he&rsquo;s a naturalist, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Remember
last fall how he went out after a picture of a fox,
and got stuck in the bog, and how Zane caught
him, all covered with mud, and thought poor Sid
was a thief, and how we pretended we didn&rsquo;t know
our own chum, when the proctor brought him to
our room for identification? Remember that,
Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say I did. Well, that&rsquo;s probably
what Sid will do this time, so Miss Harrison
needn&rsquo;t worry about having to accept him as an
escort, though for the life of me I can&rsquo;t understand
what&rsquo;s up between her and Sid?&rdquo; and Phil
looked questioningly at his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, either,&rdquo; answered Ruth, &ldquo;except
that Mabel is very miserable over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be taking it very hard, when I see
her off with that chump, Langridge,&rdquo; retorted
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry she goes with him,&rdquo; retorted
Madge Tyler. &ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t listen to us. However,
to change the subject&mdash;are we to go to the
picnic, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess so. How will we get there, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom and I will come for you, we&rsquo;ll go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
summer resort on the west shore of the lake, and
row to the island. It will be sport. Now pray
for good weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you boys pray that there aren&rsquo;t any
snakes,&rdquo; added Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor ants in the butter,&rdquo; went on Ruth, as the
boys bade the girls good-by.</p>

<h3>A SPORTY COMPANION</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my blue tie?&rdquo; cried Tom, tumbling
about the things on his bureau. &ldquo;Have you seen
it, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like your nerve! Yes, I used it as a
shoe polishing rag,&rdquo; remarked Phil sarcastically.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it on the blue-tie hook, I should say.
Why don&rsquo;t you look there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue-tie hook?&rdquo; queried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re such an orderly chap,&rdquo; added
Phil, as he looked at his chum&rsquo;s disordered side
of the room, &ldquo;that I supposed you had a hook for
each tie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut it out,&rdquo; advised Tom, making a perfect
shower with a rainbow effect of colored silks,
as he looked in vain for the blue article of adornment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where in blazes your blue tie
is,&rdquo; went on Phil, as he gazed with a puzzled
air into a box on his dresser; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to know
where my garnet cuff buttons are. Have you been
sporting &rsquo;em, Sid?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? No!&rdquo; answered the other chum, who
was quietly dressing, a task which Tom and Phil
seemed to think called for more or less elaborate
effort. &ldquo;But, say, what&rsquo;s getting into you chaps,
anyhow? You&rsquo;re togging up as much for the
soph picnic as though it was a frat. dance. Are
there some damsels in the offing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are always girls to these affairs,&rdquo;
carelessly spoke Tom, as he opened another
drawer and began tumbling about his collars and
cuffs. &ldquo;Hang it all, where <i>is</i> that tie, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose nothing but a baby-blue one would
suit your fair complexion,&rdquo; remarked Phil, glancing
at Tom, who was as brown as an Indian from
his out-door life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will suit me as well as your cute little garnet
cuff buttons will you. I never saw such a
fusser! Ah, there&rsquo;s the tie. I remember now, I
put it there to hide it away from you chaps,&rdquo; and
Tom pulled out a gorgeous affair of silk from
inside a cuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, you old fossil!&rdquo; retorted
Phil, who just then discovered his cuff buttons
marking a place in his Ovid. &ldquo;Wonder how in
blazes they got there?&rdquo; he murmured, as he proceeded
to put them in his cuffs, while Tom was
busy trying to make just the proper knot with the
blue tie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you fellows togging up so?&rdquo; demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Sid. &ldquo;Are you going to take some girls,
as well as meet some there?&rdquo; And, for the first
time he seemed to entertain some suspicions of
his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, Ruth wanted to go,&rdquo; said Phil, as
indifferently as he could, &ldquo;and Tom and I promised
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Miss Tyler is going?&rdquo; asked Sid
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Tom, his face flushing under
its bronze coat, though possibly it was from his
exertion in pulling his tie into place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so is Miss Harrison,&rdquo; went on Phil, with
a desperate effort, as if desirous of getting the
worst over. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t need to worry,&rdquo; he
added, as he saw Sid sit limply down in a chair.
&ldquo;She probably won&rsquo;t see you, so there need be
no embarrassment. I thought it was a pity to
have her miss it, especially as Ruth and Madge
are going, and she rooms with them. We thought
you wouldn&rsquo;t mind, old fellow, but we weren&rsquo;t
going to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve been so mysterious about
these last few days,&rdquo; commented Sid. &ldquo;I thought
something was up. Of course it&rsquo;s all right. I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t annoy Miss Harrison, only&mdash;Oh, what&rsquo;s
the use!&rdquo; and he went on with his preparations.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the day of the annual
sophomore picnic, and there was much excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
especially in the ranks of the second-year men,
and the more or less numerous fair ones who
counted on being taken to the charming little island
in the middle of Lake Tonoka. The affair
was always held at this season of the year, when
there was no danger of an attack from the freshmen
students, who, by this time, had settled down
into something approaching dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to back out, because she&mdash;Miss
Harrison&mdash;is coming, are you?&rdquo; asked Phil,
as he saw Sid cease his arrangements for dressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;of course not. I was just&mdash;just
thinking. I&rsquo;ll take my camera and specimen box
along, and do a little work in biology and nature
study. I need a little freshening up for the final
exams. I probably won&rsquo;t see much of you chaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil and Tom departed ahead of Sid, who
busied himself with his camera, his specimen box
and his cyanide bottle, with which latter he painlessly
killed such bugs and butterflies as he captured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; called Tom, as, with his
blue tie very much in evidence, he and Phil went
to get the girls.</p>

<p>A picnic is pretty much the same the world
over, even if it is gotten up by a college crowd,
and the one on Crest Island was no exception.
There was the usual screaming of the girls when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the boats tipped, and the usual strolling in shady
nooks by youths and maidens, there was fun galore
and happiness on all sides, for the day was
perfect.</p>

<p>Madge Tyler, Ruth Clinton and Mabel Harrison
were walking along with Phil and Tom, having
just come in from a ride around the lake in a
motor launch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon have the pleasure of seeing some
ants do a waltz or a two-step in the butter,&rdquo; announced
Tom. &ldquo;I see the waiters getting the
tables ready,&rdquo; for a caterer had been hired by
the students to provide luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How interesting,&rdquo; remarked Madge. &ldquo;Suppose
we go over there in the shade&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
paused suddenly, and with a little gesture to Ruth
went on hurriedly: &ldquo;Oh, no, let&rsquo;s go this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too sunny,&rdquo; objected Mabel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather go over in the shade, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She, too, stopped, and then she saw what had
made her chum hesitate. Sid Henderson was approaching
them on a path which had no turn in
it, as they had passed the only one just as Madge
tried to branch off. There was no help for it.
Sid was creeping up with his camera, intent on
getting a picture of a large butterfly that had
alighted on a flower, and, as yet, he had not seen
the little party.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Harrison was at once aware that her
two girl chums had endeavored to save her the
embarrassment of meeting Sid, but it was too late
to turn back gracefully now, and with an admirable
assumption of calmness the girl said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it interesting! I hope Mr. Henderson
gets his picture. I did not know he was a
naturalist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Phil both breathed easier. It seemed
that Miss Harrison would not &ldquo;cut&rdquo; Sid after
all. Perhaps their precautions had been useless.</p>

<p>They were not aware that a girl can sometimes,
under force of circumstances, assume a part she
does not feel. It was this way with Mabel Harrison.
She did not want to meet Sid, but she was
too cultured to cause his friends sorrow by refusing
to notice his presence. So, with somewhat
heightened color, she stood in the group composed
of her chums, Phil and Tom, and watched the
young naturalist coming nearer and nearer. So
intent was Sid on getting the picture that he had
not, as yet, seen his chums or the girls.</p>

<p>There was a click of the camera, and, a moment
later, after the exposure had been made, the
gorgeous butterfly sailed gracefully off through
the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo; called out Tom, and Sid
looked up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;A fine and rare specimen.&rdquo;
Then he saw Miss Harrison, and halted
in his approach, which he had begun. But, he
also, was too proud to turn back now, and came
on. The others advanced toward him, and Miss
Harrison was just bowing, coolly perhaps, but
with a show of cordiality, when from the bushes
there stepped a gaily attired youth, whom neither
Phil, Tom, nor either of the girls seemed to
know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sid, old chap!&rdquo; greeted the newcomer
in easy but rather too loud tones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
trying to pipe you off for ever so long. Looked
all over for you. Say, this place is dead slow.
Not even so much as a ring-cane game. What
makes you college sports come here? It&rsquo;s too
dead for me. But I&rsquo;ve found a bunch of good
things. Come on over and we&rsquo;ll have a little
poker, and I&rsquo;ll depend on you to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sportily dressed youth paused, for Sid had
started back with horror at the sight of him, and
had made an unmistakable gesture of caution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; went on the flashily attired
one. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I good enough to speak to
you? Or maybe you think the dames give me the
fussers. Not a bit of it. Pleased to meet you,
girls,&rdquo; and he made pert bows to the three young
ladies, who returned them with mere nods, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they expected to learn that the new arrival was
a friend of Sid&rsquo;s, however undesirable he might
seem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you here? What do you want?&rdquo;
demanded Sid, and the hand that held the camera
trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came after you,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Called
up at the brain factory, and they told me the
whole bunch of second year boys were off on a
chowder party, so I took a boat and came here.
I thought I&rsquo;d have some sport, but it&rsquo;s dead slow.
Come on, and I&rsquo;ll show you some fun. I&rsquo;ve got
a deck of cards and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid was quickly at the side of the sporty one,
and uttered something in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right then, don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo;
came the answer, and the youth leered at the
girls. Tom was with difficulty keeping down his
anger, while Phil was hopelessly wondering who
on earth Sid&rsquo;s acquaintance could be.</p>

<p>Miss Harrison, who had started to greet Sid,
drew back and there was a look of disgust on her
face. She turned aside, and started back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away&mdash;I like your style,&rdquo; called the
sporty lad. &ldquo;We need another lady as it is. Don&rsquo;t
go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; begged Sid desperately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go with you. Come on,&rdquo; and, to the surprise of
his friends, Sid turned into the woods, and followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the youth, who impudently took off his hat
and threw kisses to the girls, as they turned their
backs. Miss Harrison had disappeared around
a turn in the path.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!&rdquo;</h3>


<p>For a moment no one knew what to do or say.
Tom was nervously kicking at the pebbles in the
path, while Phil got out his knife and began whittling
a stick furiously. As usual it was the girls
who saved the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s gone off to get some more pictures,&rdquo;
said Madge, with a nervous little laugh.
&ldquo;Come on, Ruth, we mustn&rsquo;t let Mabel go back
there all alone. After all, I don&rsquo;t believe we want
to go sit in the shade. Isn&rsquo;t dinner almost ready?
I&rsquo;m nearly famished, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, bring on the butter, ants and all,&rdquo; added
Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, just as you say,&rdquo; responded Phil,
with a quick look at Tom, who rather avoided
the glance, for he was sorely puzzled. &ldquo;I dare
say grub is ready. We&rsquo;ll dine beneath the greenwood
tree, from whence all care shall banished
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Miss Tyler. &ldquo;You never told
me your brother was a poet, Ruth.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know it himself,&rdquo; commented his
sister dryly. &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Mabel. Wait!&rdquo; she
called, and the girl in advance turned. There
was a troubled look in her blue eyes, but otherwise
she was calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly charming in the woods,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;I wish Fairview College was nearer
the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll come over and get you, any time you
want to come,&rdquo; said Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Miss Harrison, with
a grateful look at him. She seemed to have recovered
control of herself, but there was a pathetic
air about her, which did not vanish.</p>

<p>Luncheon was a gay affair, as Tom and Phil
felt that it was their duty to make up, in a measure,
for the strange action of Sid, in going off
in company with a flashily-dressed youth who had
practically insulted his chums&rsquo; companions.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there was a period of idling
beneath the trees, walks along shady and moss-grown
paths, and trips about the lake in boats,
until the declining sun warned the merry-makers
that it was time to depart. Phil and Tom took
the three girls to Fairview, but they had no further
sight of Sid that afternoon, nor was any
mention made of him, though Tom rather hoped
the girls would say something that would enable
him to defend his chum.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>For, somehow, in spite of it all, Tom felt that
there was something he didn&rsquo;t understand in relation
to Sid. He was puzzled over it, grieved
deeply, too, yet he could not condemn Sid.</p>

<p>But no mention was made of the little incident
of the morning, and the two youths left,
promising to come over again at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was awfully kind of you to bother with
me,&rdquo; said Miss Harrison, as she shook hands
with Phil and Tom. &ldquo;I was rather in the way,
I&rsquo;m afraid, and I realize&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mabel, what a way to talk!&rdquo; interrupted
Ruth. &ldquo;If they hadn&rsquo;t taken you with us,
we wouldn&rsquo;t have gone with them; would we,
Madge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you,&rdquo; went on Mabel,
as she turned into the college, leaving Phil and
Tom to say good-by to their friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you make of it?&rdquo; asked Phil,
when he and Tom were on their way back to
Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanged if I know what to say. Who was
that sporty chap, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search me. He seemed to take a good deal
for granted. The puppy! I felt like punching
him one, the way he leered at the girls.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I. Would have, too, only for Sid.
He seemed to be friendly with the flashy chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s the funny part of it. He
seemed somehow to have Sid under a spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just another phase of the mystery that
seems to have been enveloping poor old Sid, of
late,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;I only hope one thing, and
that is, that whatever it is that it doesn&rsquo;t interfere
with baseball. We&rsquo;ve got to depend a lot on Sid
this season, as the other fellows aren&rsquo;t batting as
I hoped they would, and this includes myself, but
I never was much as a hitter. I never could
get above two sixty-eight, but Sid won&rsquo;t have any
trouble getting to four hundred, and he can bat
both ways, placing a ball in either right or left
field. But if this thing is going to keep up,&rdquo; and
Tom shook his head dolefully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Losing that game to Fairview didn&rsquo;t do our
standing any good,&rdquo; remarked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not! But we play Dodville Prep
school Saturday, and they&rsquo;re easy fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will help pull our average up some,&rdquo;
admitted Phil.</p>

<p>They made the rest of the trip back to Randall
almost in silence, Tom making an occasional remark
about baseball, and Phil replying, but the
thoughts of both were more on the events of the
day than on the great game.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid was not in the room when Phil and Tom
entered. The latter took off his cherished blue
tie, and placed it carefully away, probably in a
place he would forget the next time he wanted
it, while Phil made a point of sticking his garnet
sleeve links in a box that contained everything
from fish hooks to waxed ends for sewing ripped
baseball covers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to-day&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; remarked Tom,
as he threw himself in the old armchair, with a
sigh of relief, &ldquo;but it was lots of fun while it
lasted. Still I didn&rsquo;t exactly know what to do
when that fellow showed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here, yet the girls got through all right.
Trust them for a thing like that? Girls are queer
creatures, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You laughed at me when I said that last
term,&rdquo; remarked Tom, as Phil stretched out on
the ancient sofa, raising a cloud of dust. &ldquo;Well,
to-day is done. I wonder what will happen to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same old grind. I&rsquo;ve got to brush up a bit
if I want to pass with honors. Guess I&rsquo;ll do
some boning to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ve got to arrange for some more
baseball practice,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;I wonder
where Sid is? I didn&rsquo;t like the looks of that
chap. And did you hear what he said about
playing poker?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid Sid&rsquo;s in bad, in spite of what
he says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, broken only
by the ticking of the alarm clock. Then Tom resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could help him. If he&rsquo;s got in with
a bad crowd we ought to help save him. Poor
old Sid, I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and the chum
whose troubles they were discussing walked in.
He had heard what Tom had said, and a dull
red flushed up under his brown skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you fellows talking about me?&rdquo; he
asked hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just saying,&rdquo; began Phil, &ldquo;that we
couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you fellows would mind your own
business!&rdquo; blurted out Sid. &ldquo;I guess I can look
after myself!&rdquo; and he crossed the room and gazed
moodily out of a window, into the darkness of the
night, while the tick of the fussy little alarm clock
seemed to echo and re-echo through the apartment.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED DEFENSE</h3>


<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much said in the room of the
chums after Sid had &ldquo;gone off the handle,&rdquo; as
Tom expressed it later. In fact there was not
much that could be said. Phil shrugged his
shoulders and glanced at Tom in a significant
manner, and the captain of the nine shook his
head discouragedly. Matters were getting worse,
he thought, and he began to fear for the effect of
Sid&rsquo;s trouble on the second baseman&rsquo;s ability as
a player. But what could be done?</p>

<p>Though he did not refer to the scene of the
previous evening, when he greeted his chums next
morning, Sid, by his manner showed that he realized
it. There was a tender gruffness in his words
and actions, and he seemed so contrite, and so
anxious to make amends that Phil and Tom did
not have it in their hearts to stand out against
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine day for practice,&rdquo; observed Tom, as
he sprang out of bed, at the first summons of
the alarm clock.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s battle-axe! What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;
demanded Phil, lazily turning over.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;m behind in my psychology work,
and I&rsquo;ve got to attend a stiff lecture this morning
and stand for a quizz afterward. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll
slump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; came unexpectedly from Sid.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been all over that stuff, and I know what
Pitchfork will try to stick you on. Get something
on, and I&rsquo;ll help you bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was unexpected on Sid&rsquo;s part, but Tom
was none the less grateful, and soon the two were
delving deep into problems of mind and matter,
while Phil protested that it was against all rules,
and that he wanted to sleep.</p>

<p>Tom did well in the &ldquo;quizz,&rdquo; and this made
him more than ever anxious to help Sid in his
trouble. But the second baseman made no reference
to it, and in practice that afternoon he did
better than in several previous days at his stick
work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat up Dodville,&rdquo; prophesied Tom exultantly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to lambast &rsquo;em, Sid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Randall didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;eat up&rdquo; Dodville. They
beat the preparatory school nine, as indeed they
should have done, but the score was no great
showing of the abilities of Randall.</p>

<p>For the smaller lads hit Tom rather too frequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and their fielding was a joy to the heart
of their coach and captain. Even Mr. Leighton
complimented them on it, and he did not say much
to his own men, who, to say the least, were a bit
ragged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dodville shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten more than
one run,&rdquo; declared the coach as the nine was returning,
&ldquo;yet you fellows let them get six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tom bitterly. &ldquo;I can see a large,
gold-framed picture of us winning that loving
cup, when we go up against Boxer Hall and Fairview
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; declared Sid, somewhat
bitterly. &ldquo;You issued plenty of walking papers
to-day, and they found you several times, in spite
of your curves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t muff a ball, and let a man get away
from me on second, though,&rdquo; retorted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s sing,&rdquo; proposed
Holly Cross, as a way out of the difficulty, and
when some of the old college lays had been rendered
the team was in better humor.</p>

<p>That evening, when Tom was putting a new
toe-plate on his shoe, and Sid was pretending to
study in one corner of the room, but scarcely
glancing at his book, there came a summons at
the door. Sid jumped up at the knock, and there
was a look of apprehension on his face, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
vanished, however, when Wallops, the messenger,
came with word that Phil was wanted on the telephone.
The first baseman returned presently, to
announce:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister wants to see me, over at Fairview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom quickly,
and with suspicious interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she has a letter from dad, with something
in about vacation plans, and she wants to talk
to me about it. I&rsquo;ll be back soon. Don&rsquo;t sit up
for me&mdash;ta-ta,&rdquo; and Phil was gone.</p>

<p>It was not quite as difficult for him to gain admission
to the young ladies&rsquo; side of the Fairview
institution as it had been for Tom, on one memorable
occasion, when he had called to tell Ruth
that her brother had been hurt in a football game.
Then Miss Philock, the preceptress, seemed to
think Tom was going to carry off some of her
charges out of hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, sis?&rdquo; asked Phil, when his sister
had come down to talk to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s about where we&rsquo;re going this summer.
Dad and Momsey have left it to me. I
want to go to Europe awfully, Phil, and if you
and I both ask, maybe they&rsquo;ll take us. Will you?
That&rsquo;s what I wanted to see you about, and I
couldn&rsquo;t wait to write, so I telephoned. Don&rsquo;t
you want to go to Europe?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much! I&rsquo;m going camping with Sid and
Tom. No Europe for me! We&rsquo;re going to do
Yellowstone Park, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil, and I was so counting on Europe,&rdquo;
and Ruth began to argue with her brother. In
the midst of it the door of the little reception
room opened, and in came Madge and Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse us, dear,&rdquo; exclaimed Madge. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do stay,&rdquo; urged Ruth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Phil. Perhaps
you can help me persuade him to join with
me in begging the folks to take us to Europe,&rdquo;
and Phil&rsquo;s sister looked knowingly at Madge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t that be fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Tyler. &ldquo;I heard mamma and papa talking about
making a tour this year, and of course if they
went I&rsquo;d go too. Then we might see each other,
Ruth. I don&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;re so opposed to
Europe, Mr. Clinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Phil quickly, doing
some hard thinking before he reversed himself.
&ldquo;In fact I rather like it. Perhaps we will postpone
the camping trip and&mdash;er&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t
care, sis. If you can work the folks for a trip
across the pond I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth,
and she made a motion as though to kiss her
brother, only Phil ducked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How fortunate you people are to go abroad,&rdquo;
spoke Miss Harrison. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been longing to go,&rdquo;
and they began to talk of many things they wished
to see. From that the talk switched to baseball,
and before she thought Ruth remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Henderson batting as well as ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as well as he might,&rdquo; declared Phil, and
he spoke not to disparage Sid, but merely as a
lover of his team. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong
with Sid,&rdquo; he went on, scarcely aware of what he
was saying. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going down, somehow. I&rsquo;m
afraid he&rsquo;s gotten in with a bad crowd. That
sporty chap we met him with isn&rsquo;t doing him any
good, and Sid will slump, if he isn&rsquo;t careful. He
used to be a steady chap, but I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s going
to the bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a shame!&rdquo; remarked Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he was so steady,&rdquo; added Madge.</p>

<p>Miss Harrison was biting her lips. Her face
had first flushed, but now was white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very mean of you to say such
things about him when he isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; she burst
out. &ldquo;Sid&mdash;I mean Mr. Henderson&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;I
mean&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;anyhow, why don&rsquo;t
you be fair to him?&rdquo; and, before any of the others
could answer, she burst into tears and fled from
the room.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>A SERIOUS CHARGE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that?&rdquo; exclaimed
Phil, turning to his sister and Miss
Tyler. &ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t the limit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; begged Ruth. &ldquo;Poor Mabel! She
isn&rsquo;t herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t saying anything against Sid,&rdquo; went
on Phil. &ldquo;I only said it was too bad something
seemed to have gotten hold of him lately. Then
she flies up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you speak about Mabel flying up?&rdquo;
interrupted Ruth, stamping her little foot, and
shaking her finger at her brother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s nervous
and upset, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;d better go to her,
Madge. Perhaps she has a headache.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Tyler, with a sympathetic look at Phil,
glided from the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose ailed Miss Harrison?&rdquo;
asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Ruth. &ldquo;Of course it
was rather unexpected when she and Mr. Henderson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
became such friends. Then came that item
in the paper, and his refusal to explain, and then
meeting that horrid fellow at the picnic, and then&mdash;but
I never expected her to break a lance for
him in this fashion. I guess she cares more than
she shows,&rdquo; and with this philosophical reflection
Ruth bade her brother good night, as Miss Philock
was marching aggressively up and down the
corridor like a sentinel, for the hour of retiring
was approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t say a word about this to Sid,&rdquo;
cautioned Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; growled Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor Tom Parsons, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil grunted, but that night he told Tom everything,
and the scene further added, in the mind
of the pitcher, to the mystery that was enveloping
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe the worst of it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; suggested Tom,
as they were discussing the matter. &ldquo;Sid hasn&rsquo;t
been out late nights for two weeks now, and he&rsquo;s
studying hard. He&rsquo;s playing the game, too.
We&rsquo;ll beat Fairview the next time we tackle &rsquo;em,
and wipe up Boxer Hall, likewise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But alas for Tom&rsquo;s hopes. Two nights later,
as the three chums were studying in their room,
Wallops brought a note for Sid, who showed
much perturbation, and hastily went out, saying
nothing to his chums.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There he goes again,&rdquo; remarked Tom helplessly,
as the door closed on Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; grunted Phil. He had nothing to say.</p>

<p>Phil and Tom, who were taking up some advanced
work in mathematics, spent two evenings
a week &ldquo;boning&rdquo; with Mellville, a senior, and
this was one of the occasions when they went to
his room. They had permission to be up beyond
the usual hour, and it was rather late when they
returned to their own apartment. Mellville had
his rooms in a new fraternity house, not far from
Booker Memorial Chapel, and to get to their
own room, which was in the west dormitory, Phil
and Tom had to cross the campus, and go in the
rear of the &ldquo;prof house,&rdquo; as the building was
called where Dr. Churchill and the faculty had
their living quarters. As the two chums were
walking along, they became aware of a figure
coming up the campus from another direction&mdash;from
where the main entrance gates of the college
loomed up dimly in the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s coming in late,&rdquo; murmured Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely to get caught,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;I saw
Proc. Zane sneaking around a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, that walks like Sid!&rdquo; whispered Phil,
a moment later. &ldquo;It is Sid,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there goes Zane after him!&rdquo; groaned
Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s caught, sure, unless we can warn
him. Poor old Sid!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; remarked Phil, as he saw the figure
of the proctor break into a run. Sid also
darted off, but soon he saw he had no chance to
escape, and he stood still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Henderson, good evening,&rdquo; greeted
the proctor sarcastically. &ldquo;Out rather late, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid so, sir,&rdquo; answered Sid hesitatingly;
his two chums, from their position in
the dark shadows of the faculty house being able
to hear everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; went on the proctor gleefully.
He had kept vigil for many nights of late,
and his prey had escaped him. Now he had a
quarry. &ldquo;Have you permission to be out after
hours?&rdquo; demanded the official.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought not. Report to Dr. Churchill directly
after chapel,&rdquo; and the proctor, by the light
of a small pocket electric lamp he carried, began
to enter Sid&rsquo;s name in his book. As he did so
Tom and Phil could see the watch-dog of the
college gate gaze sharply at their chum. Then
Mr. Zane, putting out his hand, caught hold of
Sid&rsquo;s coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they going to fight?&rdquo; asked Tom in a
hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Sid must be crazy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later came the proctor&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, Mr. Henderson, I thought I smelled liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
on you! I am not deceived. What have
you in that pocket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noth&mdash;nothing, sir,&rdquo; stammered Sid.</p>

<p>There was a momentary struggle, and the
proctor pulled something from an inner pocket of
Sid&rsquo;s coat. By the gleam of the electric lamp,
Tom and Phil could see that it was a bottle&mdash;a
flask of the kind usually employed to carry intoxicants&mdash;broad
and flat, to fit in the pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Mr. Henderson, this is serious!&rdquo; exclaimed
the proctor. &ldquo;Trying to smuggle liquor
into the college! Come with me to my room at
once. This must be investigated. I will find out
who are guilty with you, in this most serious
breach of the rules. A bottle of liquor! Shameful!
Come with me, sir! Dr. Churchill shall
hear of this instantly!&rdquo; and he took hold of Sid&rsquo;s
arm, as if he feared the student would escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; gasped Tom, as
the full meaning of what he had seen came home
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; answered Phil hopelessly. &ldquo;Poor,
old Sid!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3>SID KEEPS SILENT</h3>


<p>Tom and Phil wished they could have been a
witness to the scene which took place a little later
in the study of Dr. Churchill. Not from mere
motives of curiosity, but that they might, if possible,
aid their chum. That he was in serious
straits they well knew, for the rules of Randall
(as indeed is the case at all colleges) were most
stringent on the subject of liquor.</p>

<p>Poor Sid, led like a prisoner by the proctor,
walked moodily up to the faculty residence, while
Tom and Phil, with sorrow in their hearts, went
to their room. Their grief was too deep and
genuine to admit of discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wished to see me?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Churchill,
coming out of his study into his reception
room, as Sid and the proctor stood up to greet
him, having previously sent in word by the servant.
&ldquo;Ha, what is it now?&rdquo; and the venerable
head of Randall looked over the tops of his
spectacles at the two; the official, stern and unyielding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and the student with a puzzled, worried
air, sorrowful yet not at all guilty. Dr. Churchill
held a book and his finger was between the pages,
as if he hoped soon to be able to go back and resume
his reading at the place he had left off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret to announce that I have a most flagrant
violation of the rules to report to you, Dr.
Churchill,&rdquo; began Mr. Zane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another of my boys out late,&rdquo; remarked the
doctor, a half smile playing around his lips.
&ldquo;Well, of course that can&rsquo;t be allowed, but I suppose
he has some good excuse. He went to see
about a challenge for a ball game, or it was so
hot in his room that he couldn&rsquo;t study,&rdquo; and the
president smiled, then, as he caught sight of a
little blaze of logs in the fireplace of his reception
room (for the evening was rather chilly), he
realized that his latter explanation about a hot
room would scarcely hold. And, be it said, Dr.
Churchill was always looking for some excuse for
indiscreet students, to the chagrin of the officious
proctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless a baseball matter took him out,&rdquo;
went on the president. &ldquo;Of course we can&rsquo;t allow
that. Discipline is discipline, but if you will write
out for me a couple of hundred lines of Virgil&mdash;by
the way, you play at shortstop, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and
the doctor looked quizzically at Sid. The president
had rather less knowledge of baseball than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the average lady. &ldquo;How is the eleven coming on,
Mr. Henderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor tried to appear interested, but, for
the life of him he never could remember whether
baseball was played with nine, ten or a dozen
men, albeit he attended all the championship
games, and shouted with the rest when the team
won. He wanted to appear interested now, however,
and he was anxious to get back to his
reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret to inform you,&rdquo; went on the proctor
(which was not true, for Sid well knew that Mr.
Zane took a fiendish delight in what he was about
to say), &ldquo;I regret to state that I caught Mr.
Henderson coming in after hours to-night; and I
would not think so much of that, were it not for
the condition in which I caught him,&rdquo; and the
proctor assumed a saintly air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; remarked the doctor,
laying down his book, but taking care to
mark a certain passage. Sid was idly aware that
it was a volume of Sanskrit, the doctor being an
authority on that ancient language of the Hindoos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret to say that Mr. Henderson is intoxicated!&rdquo;
blurted out the proctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not, sir!&rdquo; retorted the second baseman,
it being his first remark since entering the room.
&ldquo;I have never touched a drop of intoxicating liquor
in my life, sir!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a ring in his voice, and, as he stood
up and faced his accuser there was that in his
manner which would indicate to any unprejudiced
person that he was perfectly sober.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Intoxicated!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, for he
had a nameless horror of anything like that.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a charge, Mr. Zane, unless you
are positive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am positive, Dr. Churchill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never touched a drop of liquor,&rdquo; insisted
Sid.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill, with a stern look on his rugged
face, advanced and took hold of Sid by the arms,
not severely, not even tightly, but with a gentle,
friendly pressure. He looked into the troubled
eyes of the lad&mdash;troubled but not ashamed&mdash;worried,
perhaps, but not abashed. The doctor
bent closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no authority on intoxicants,&rdquo; went on
the president grimly, &ldquo;but I should say you were
mistaken, Mr. Zane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Mr. Henderson deny that I took a pint
bottle of liquor from him not ten minutes ago?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Zane, as he produced the incriminating
evidence.</p>

<p>Sid&rsquo;s face turned red under its tan&mdash;it had
been rather pale before&mdash;but he did not answer.
Dr. Churchill looked grave.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did have the bottle in my pocket,&rdquo; admitted
Sid. &ldquo;But it was not for myself. I took it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The president raised a restraining hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will send for Dr. Marshall.
This is serious.&rdquo; He sighed as he looked
at his book. To-night he felt, more than ever,
what it meant, to be the head of an institution
where several hundred young men&mdash;healthy, vitalized
animals&mdash;were held in leash only by slender
cords. Dr. Churchill summoned a messenger,
and sent him for the college physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henderson is no more intoxicated than
I am, and I never take a drop, nor give it,&rdquo; declared
the physician. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re mistaken,
Mr. Zane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this liquor?&rdquo; demanded the proctor, extending
the bottle.</p>

<p>Dr. Marshall looked at the bottle through the
light, poured out some of the contents into his
palm, and smelled of the liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to be whisky,&rdquo; he said doubtfully,
&ldquo;but I should have to make an analysis to be perfectly
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not go to that trouble,&rdquo; said Sid
quickly. &ldquo;I have every reason to believe that it <i>is</i>
whisky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what were you doing with it?&rdquo; demanded
Dr. Churchill sternly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a question which I must decline to
answer,&rdquo; and Sid drew himself up haughtily.</p>

<p>The venerable president drew back, almost as
if he had received a blow. He looked at Sid
keenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he remarked quietly, and there
was a note of sadness in his voice. &ldquo;I shall
have to inflict severe punishment. The rules call
for suspension or expulsion, but, in view of your
previous excellent record, I will make an exception.
You will be debarred from all further participation
in athletics for the remainder of the
term&mdash;unless,&rdquo; and the doctor paused, &ldquo;you can
make some explanation that will prove your innocence,&rdquo;
and he looked almost as a father might
at an erring son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make any explanation,&rdquo; answered
Sid brokenly, as he turned away, while the doctor,
with a shake of his head, took up his Sanskrit
book, and went back to his study.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>BASCOME GIVES A DINNER</h3>


<p>Of course, the story was all over college the
next day, for those things leak out, through messengers
or servants, or in some mysterious manner.
But, in this case, the suspension of Sid from
further participation in the ball games, had to
be made known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of onions, what are we going
to do?&rdquo; demanded Tom. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do without
Sid.&rdquo; He was quite broken up over the affair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to play Pete Backus in his place,&rdquo;
suggested Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but Pete&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the perplexed
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to train harder than he has been,&rdquo;
observed the coach, who, with Tom and some
friends, were talking over the alarming situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pete&rsquo;ll do it, if he once makes up his
mind to it, and I&rsquo;ll see that he does,&rdquo; agreed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does this mean that we&rsquo;ll have to cancel the
next game with Fairview?&rdquo; asked Ed Kerr, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was anxious to know, for, as manager, he would
have to shift his dates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll play &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied the coach. &ldquo;It
will mean more and harder practice for the next
two weeks, though, and we have a game with
that Michigan school Saturday. They&rsquo;re hard
as nails, too, I hear, but maybe it will do our
fellows good to get a few more drubbings. It
may wake them up, for there&rsquo;s no denying that
the fellows are not playing up to the mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; began Tom, a
bit aggressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it was,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Leighton,
and there was a sharp tone in his words. &ldquo;Only
we&rsquo;ve got to play better if we want to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom, with a fierce feeling in his heart, put
his men through a hard practice previous to a
game with the scrub team, and the men seemed
to wake up. Pete Backus surprised his chums and
himself by knocking a home run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work like that wins games,&rdquo; added the coach,
brightening up a bit.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil, in tacit agreement with the rest
of the athletic set, had avoided mentioning Sid&rsquo;s
disgrace, but coming home from practice that
afternoon, Tom, seeing his chum, curled up in
the old armchair, studying, could not help remarking:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world did you do it for, old man?
You&rsquo;ve put us in a fierce hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; spoke Sid contritely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you explain?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean there&rsquo;s nothing to explain?&rdquo; queried
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can put it that way, if you like. I wish
you fellows would let me alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Sid,&rdquo; went on Tom, &ldquo;but
when we count on you to play on the team&mdash;and
when we need you&mdash;to go back on us this way&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me alone; will you?&rdquo; burst out the
unfortunate one. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I got troubles enough?
You know it hurts me, as much as it does you, not
to play. Don&rsquo;t I want to see Randall win?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look much like it,&rdquo; mumbled Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, look here,&rdquo; exploded Sid, &ldquo;if you fellows
don&rsquo;t want me here any longer, just say so,
and I&rsquo;ll get out.&rdquo; He sprang to his feet, and
faced his chums, a look on his face they had
never seen there before. It brought to them a
realization of what it all meant, though they
could not understand it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all, we&rsquo;re getting too serious!&rdquo;
declared Tom. &ldquo;Of course, we want you to stay
here&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do if you left
us. Only it&rsquo;s tough on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad you appreciate my abilities,&rdquo; remarked
Sid, with a little softening of his manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
as much broken up over it as you are. All I
can say is there&rsquo;s been a big mistake, and all I
ask for is a suspension of judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s a mistake, why can&rsquo;t you tell?&rdquo; insisted
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ll have to worry along
without me. I hear Pete is doing good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, fair,&rdquo; admitted Tom, &ldquo;but he isn&rsquo;t
as sure a batter as you are. We need you, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. It may be explained&mdash;some
day, but not now,&rdquo; and Sid fell
to studying again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; remarked Tom to Phil, a
few days later, following some practice the day
before the game with Michigan, a team that had
won a name for itself on the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like what, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way some of our team are playing and
acting. They seem to think any old kind of baseball
will do. They play fine&mdash;at times&mdash;then they
go to pieces. Then, too, there seems to be a sort
of clique forming in the nine and among some of
the subs. There&rsquo;s too much sporting around, and
staying out nights. Too many little suppers and
smokers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leighton doesn&rsquo;t kick&mdash;why should you?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know it, but if it keeps on I&rsquo;m
going to tell him, and have him stiffen up the
men. Ed Kerr&rsquo;s got to help, too. Bert Bascome
is responsible for some of it. He&rsquo;s got lots of
money, and he spends it. Then, with his auto,
he&rsquo;s playing old bob with some of the fellows,
taking them on joy rides, and keeping them out
until, first they know, Zane will have them down
on his list.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not as bad as that, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, eh? You just watch, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; and
Tom kept moodily on to his room. On the table
were three envelopes, one each for the captain,
Sid and Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;I wonder if Ruth
is going to have a blow-out again, or if
Madge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his missive and began to read it,
Tom already having perused his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, what did I tell you?&rdquo; asked the captain.
&ldquo;Bascome is giving a dinner to-night, and
he wants the whole &rsquo;varsity nine, and the subs, to
attend. The little puppy! He gives himself as
many airs as if he was a senior. Why doesn&rsquo;t
he dine the freshman nine, if he has to blow in
his money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going? Of course not, and none of the nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
will, if they have to ask me. It will break them
all up for the game to-morrow. I won&rsquo;t stand
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Leighton, and have him officially forbid
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that going it pretty strong? We can
easily beat Michigan, even if the fellows do have
a little fun to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look how we were fooled on Dodville Prep.
I&rsquo;m going to take no chances. I&rsquo;ll see Leighton,&rdquo;
which Tom did, with the effect that the coach
kindly, but firmly, forbade members of the &rsquo;varsity
nine from dissipating at Bascome&rsquo;s dinner.</p>

<p>Sid came in a little later, picked up his invitation,
and read it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say Bascome gives very fine spreads,&rdquo;
was his remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going, are you?&rdquo; asked Tom in
some surprise, for he likened Bascome to Langridge,
though the latter was more of a bully, and
he did not believe Sid would take up with the
rich freshman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I go?&rdquo; asked Sid, and there
was challenge in his tone. &ldquo;I might as well have
the game as the name,&rdquo; and he laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, none of the &rsquo;varsity nine are going,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and Sid turned aside, as he put the invitation
in his pocket. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not on the
&rsquo;varsity any longer,&rdquo; and he laughed, but there
was no mirth in it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>FAIRVIEW AND RANDALL</h3>


<p>Tom did not reply to Sid&rsquo;s almost sneering
allusion to the unfortunate fact that he was barred
from playing. There was little the captain could
say, and when Sid went to Bascome&rsquo;s dinner, together
with a number of the more sporty students,
Tom and Phil, who were in bed, did not
greet their chum on his return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you fellows?&rdquo; demanded
Sid, as he entered the darkened room,
and proceeded to get ready to retire. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
think I&rsquo;d committed an unpardonable crime. It
was a jolly crowd I was with, and nothing out
of the way. Bascome isn&rsquo;t half bad, when you
get to know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a little fresh, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; remarked Phil,
while Tom mumbled a few words that might
have been taken for anything.</p>

<p>The game with Michigan the next day demonstrated
in how poor a condition was Randall, for
the contest nearly went by the board, and Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
only pulled it out of the fire by excellent pitching,
though he was not in the best of form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we won, anyhow,&rdquo; remarked Phil that
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but nothing to boast of. I&rsquo;m worried
about the Fairview game Saturday,&rdquo; said the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we play on their grounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something in our favor. We&rsquo;ll
have Bean Perkins and the other shouters with
us. We&rsquo;ve just got to win, Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no &lsquo;buts,&rsquo; old man,&rdquo; declared the
genial first baseman. &ldquo;Just remember that the
girls will be on hand, and they mustn&rsquo;t see us go
down to defeat twice to a co-ed college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; and Tom turned in.</p>

<p>The following days were devoted to practice&mdash;practice
harder than any yet that term, for Tom
and the coach worked the men every spare hour
they could devote to the diamond, outside of lecture
and study hours. Pete Backus improved
wonderfully. He was not Sid&rsquo;s equal, but the
best substitute that could be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid, but I wish you were going to play,&rdquo;
said Tom, with a little sigh, the night before the
Fairview game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; came in sorrowful tones from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
second baseman. &ldquo;But&mdash;Oh, well, what&rsquo;s the use
of talking?&rdquo; and he tried to laugh it off, but it
was a poor attempt.</p>

<p>Fairview was on hand early with a crowd of
&ldquo;rooters&rdquo; and supporters, both young men and
maidens, the next afternoon, when the Randall
team fairly leaped out on the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Ruth is here?&rdquo; said Phil, as he
stopped a particularly &ldquo;hot&rdquo; ball Tom threw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look,&rdquo; suggested the pitcher, and
while the grand stand and bleachers were filling
up the two strolled along, scanning the hundreds
of faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; cried Tom at length. &ldquo;Miss
Tyler&rsquo;s with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Harrison is up there, too,&rdquo; added
Phil. &ldquo;And see who&rsquo;s with her&mdash;Miss Harrison,
I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;I
guess he came to get a line on us. Well, he&rsquo;ll
get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer place he picked out to see the game
from,&rdquo; went on Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be sunny there, after a bit,&rdquo; replied Phil,
for part of the seating accommodations on the
Randall grounds were not of the best, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
grand stands were little better than the bleachers
in the matter of shade. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have the sun almost
in his face before the game is half over,&rdquo;
continued the first baseman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it suits him, we oughtn&rsquo;t to kick,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I s&rsquo;pose not. Hello, if there isn&rsquo;t Sid,
and he&rsquo;s going to sit right down behind Langridge
and Miss Harrison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em. Rather
awkward if he and Langridge have a run-in here.
But come on, we&rsquo;ll say how-d&rsquo;y-do to the girls,
and then get at practice,&rdquo; and, after greeting their
friends, and assuring them that Fairview would go
home beaten, Tom and Phil took their places with
the other players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, we&rsquo;ve got to win!&rdquo; declared
Tom emphatically just before the game started.
&ldquo;Last time we played Fairview we lost by a
score of ten to three. Don&rsquo;t let it happen again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t you dare to,&rdquo; cautioned Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>A moment later the Randall players went out
in the field, the home team having the privilege
of batting last. The umpire took the new ball
from its foil cover, and tossed it to Tom. The
tall, good-looking pitcher looked at it critically,
glanced around the field to see that his men were
in position, and then sent in a few practice balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to Dutch Housenlager, who loomed up big and
confident behind home plate.</p>

<p>Ted Puder, the Fairview center fielder and
captain, was the first man up, and was greeted
with a round of cheers as he tapped his bat on
the rubber. Dutch signalled for an out curve
and Tom delivered it, right over the plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; called the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; jeered Fairview&rsquo;s friends, for Puder
had not swung at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robber!&rdquo; yelled some one, but the Fairview
captain only laughed. &ldquo;Make him give you a
good one, Puder,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>But waiting availed Puder nothing, for Tom
neatly struck him out, and followed it by doing
the same to Lem Sellig. Frank Sullivan managed
to find Tom&rsquo;s second delivery, and sent a neat
little liner out toward Bricktop Molloy, at short.
Bricktop seemed to have it fairly in his grasp,
even though he had to reach out to one side for
it, but his foot slipped, and the ball went on past
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Frank, run!&rdquo; screamed a score of voices,
and Frank legged it for first, reaching the bag
before Joe Jackson in left field could run up and
redeem Bricktop&rsquo;s error by stopping the rolling
ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, two down&mdash;play for the batter,&rdquo;
advised Dutch in a signal to Tom, and the pitcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
nodded comprehendingly. Ned Williams, who
followed Sullivan, knocked two fouls, both of
which Dutch tried hard to get, but could not.
Then Tom struck him out with a puzzling drop,
and a goose egg went up on the score board for
Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;re not finding us as soft as they
expected,&rdquo; remarked Holly Cross, as his side
came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early yet,&rdquo; advised Tom. &ldquo;Wait until
about the fifth inning, and then talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to spank me?&rdquo; asked Bricktop,
as he came up to Tom, looking sorrowful over
his error.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it again, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Coach
Leighton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds,&rdquo; promised the red-haired
shortstop.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>RANDALL SCORES FIRST</h3>


<p>Holly Cross was up first, and he faced John
Allen, the Fairview pitcher, with a grin of confidence.
He swung viciously at the first ball, and
missed it clean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him give you a nice one,&rdquo; called Bricktop,
who was coaching from third. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
all day, Holly. He&rsquo;ll tire in about two innings.
He has no Irish blood in him, as I have,&rdquo; and
there was a laugh at Bricktop&rsquo;s &ldquo;rigging&rdquo; while
the Fairview pitcher smiled sheepishly.</p>

<p>But though Holly waited, it availed him but
little. Three balls were called for him, after his
first strike, though the Fairview crowd wanted
to injure the umpire. Then Allen stiffened, and
Holly walked back to the bench without even
swinging the stick again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one gone. We&rsquo;ve got plenty of chances
yet,&rdquo; called Bricktop, from the coaching box, and
in his enthusiasm he stepped over the line. The
umpire warned him back. Dan Woodhouse was
up next.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Make kindling wood of your bat,&rdquo; yelled an
enthusiastic freshman in the Randall bleachers,
but though Dan sent a nice bingle to center, well
over the pitcher&rsquo;s head, the second baseman pulled
it down, and Dan was out. Bricktop repeated
this, save that he flied to Herbert Bower, in left
field, and Randall had a zero to her credit.</p>

<p>In the second and third innings neither side
scored, and when the fourth was half over, with
another minus mark for Fairview the crowd began
to sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll be a hot game before it&rsquo;s through,&rdquo;
prophesied Bert Bascome, who with Ford Fenton,
and a crowd of like spirits sat together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Ford. &ldquo;My uncle
says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down! Sit down!&rdquo; yelled a score of voices
about him, though the unfortunate Ford was not
standing. He knew, however, what was meant,
and uttered no protest.</p>

<p>Though Randall did her best when her chance
came in the ending of the fourth, nothing resulted.
Backus flied to Sam Soden and Tom Parsons
managed to get to first on a clean hit to
right field, but Joe Jackson, who followed him,
struck out, and, as though emulating his brother,
the other Jersey twin did likewise, letting Tom
die on second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, when is something going to happen?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
asked Holly Cross of Tom, as the home team
filed out in the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to, pretty soon now,&rdquo; replied Tom,
as he kicked a small stone out of the pitchers&rsquo; box.</p>

<p>Bean Perkins, with his crowd of &ldquo;shouters&rdquo;
started the &ldquo;Wallop &rsquo;em&rdquo; song, in an endeavor to
make things lively, and he very nearly succeeded,
for John Allen, who came up first in the beginning
of the fifth, rapped out a pretty one to left field.
It looked as if Joe Jackson would miss it, but
Joe wasn&rsquo;t there for that purpose. He had a
long run to the side to get within reaching distance
of the horsehide, but, as though to make up
for striking out, he made a sensational catch, and
was roundly applauded, while Allen walked back
disgustedly from first, which he had almost
reached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty catch! Lovely catch!&rdquo; yelled Bean
Perkins. &ldquo;Now a couple more like that, and
things will be all ready for us when our boys
come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herbert Bower and Sam Soden, the next two
Fairview players who followed Allen, were both
struck out by Tom, who was doing some fine
twirling, having given no player his base on balls
yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, show &rsquo;em what you can do!&rdquo;
pleaded a score of Randall &ldquo;fans,&rdquo; as Tom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his men walked in to the bench for their share
of the fifth inning.</p>

<p>Dutch Housenlager was up first, and he selected
a bat with care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, me son,&rdquo; asked
Bricktop solicitously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knock a home run,&rdquo; declared Dutch, and he
faced the pitcher with a grim air. He didn&rsquo;t do
that, but he did rap out a single, and got to first.
Then came Phil Clinton, who made a sacrifice
bunt. That is, it was intended for that, but the
pitcher fumbled it, and was delayed in getting it
to first. Then the throw was so wild that the
Fairview first baseman had to take his foot off the
bag to get it, and, meanwhile Phil was legging it
for the bag for all he was worth, while Dutch
went on to second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Batter&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; howled the umpire, though it
seemed to all the Randall players that Phil was
safe. Tom protested hotly at the decision, but
it stood, and, though it looked as if there would
be trouble, Mr. Leighton calmed things down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one gone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Holly Cross
is up next. He&rsquo;ll bring in Dutch, and score himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holly sent out a beautiful hit to center field,
and there was a chorus of joyful cries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a home run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Dutch, you old ice wagon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dutch legged it from second to third, and
started home, but the ball, which the center fielder
had managed to get sooner than had been expected,
looked dangerous to Dutch, and he ran
back to third, after being halfway home. Holly
was safe on second, and amid a storm of encouraging
yells Dan Woodhouse got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now a home run, Kindlings!&rdquo; called the
crowd, and then Bean and his cohorts began
singing: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Got &rsquo;em on the Run Now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dan got two balls, and the third one was just
where he wanted it. <a href="#image01">He slammed it out for a
three base hit</a>, and Dutch and Holly scored the
first two runs of the game, while Tom did a war
dance at third, where he was coaching. On a
single by Bricktop Dan came in, though he was
nearly caught at home, for the ball was quickly
relayed in from left field, where the shortstop
had sent it, but old Kindlings slid in through a
cloud of dust, and Charley Simonson, who was
catching for Fairview, dropped the horsehide, so
Dan&rsquo;s run counted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;nothing! Three&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; yelled
Tom, wild with joy. &ldquo;Now, boys, we&rsquo;ve struck
our gait! And only one out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch his glass arm break!&rdquo; shouted several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in scorn at the Fairview pitcher, but the latter
refused to let them get his &ldquo;goat&rdquo; or rattle him
and kept a watchful eye on Bricktop at first, when
Pete Backus came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Pete, don&rsquo;t forget what I told you!&rdquo;
shouted Tom, as the lad who was taking Sid&rsquo;s
place stepped up, but poor Pete must have had
a poor memory, for he struck out, and when Tom
himself took up his stick, Bricktop, who had been
vainly trying to steal second and who was somewhat
tired out, by the pitcher&rsquo;s efforts to catch
him napping on first, finally did what the Fairview
players hoped he would do&mdash;he played off
too far, and he couldn&rsquo;t get back, when Allen
suddenly slammed the ball over to the first baseman.
Bricktop was out, and the Randall side
was retired, but with three runs to its credit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for a starter,&rdquo; observed Tom, as
he put on his pitching glove. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll duplicate
that next inning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sixth saw goose eggs in the frames of
both nines, though Tom sent a pretty, low fly out
to center, where it was neatly caught by Ted
Puder, who had to jump for it. The Jersey
twins struck out in monotonous succession, thus
ending the sixth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the lucky seventh!&rdquo; yelled a crowd
of Fairview supporters. &ldquo;Everybody stand up!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and the big crowd arose to get some relief from
sitting still so long.</p>

<p>The seventh was destined to be lucky in spite
of the efforts of Tom and his men to hold back
Fairview.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3>RANDALL IN THE TENTH</h3>


<p>Lem Sellig, who was up first for Fairview,
had what Tom thought was a wicked look in his
eye. Whether Tom lost control or whether Lem
surprised himself and his friends by finding the
ball, in spite of its puzzling curve was not known,
but at any rate he knocked a two bagger, and it
was almost a three sacker, for the center fielder
dropped the ball, and had some time in finding
it in the grass before he threw it in just in time
to shut off Lem from going to third. This stroke
of luck seemed to give Fairview confidence, and
Frank Sullivan almost duplicated Lem&rsquo;s trick,
bringing in the third baseman, and getting to second
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to walk away from &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
declared Lem, as he tallied the first run for his
side, and it did look so, for Ned Williams found
Tom Parsons for a couple of fouls. But the
fatal blow was wanting, and Ned went back to
the bench, amid groans. Sullivan stole to third
on a ball that managed to get past Dutch at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and then followed a wild scene when John Allen
knocked a pretty fly, bringing in Frank, but getting
out himself. This made the score two to
three in favor of Randall, and there was a nervous
tension when Tom got ready to attend to
Herbert Bower, the next man up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to dispose of him with some style,&rdquo;
thought the Randall twirler, &ldquo;or our fellows will
get rattled. Let&rsquo;s see if I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It looked a bit discouraging when his first two
deliveries were called balls, but the next three
could not have been better, and Bower was struck
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we&rsquo;ve got to do is hold &rsquo;em down now,
and we&rsquo;ve got the game,&rdquo; declared Dutch, as he
walked with Tom in from the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get some more runs,&rdquo; insisted
the captain.</p>

<p>But they didn&rsquo;t. Dutch, Phil and Holly went
down in one, two, three order. And a zero went
up in the seventh frame for Randall.</p>

<p>Tom struck out Sam Soden for a starter in the
eighth, and then he lost his balance, or something
else happened, for he issued a free pass to
first for Simonson, amid a chorus of groans from
the Randall lads, and jeers from Fairview, who
hurled such encouraging remarks at Tom as these:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him going now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all in!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have his goat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk about glass arms!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it was this jeering, or whether Tom
was really tired, did not develop, but, at any
rate, Ed Felton, who followed Simonson, placed
a magnificent hit just inside the first base line,
and with such speed did it go that it sifted down
in through the seats of the right field bleachers,
and Ed scored the first home run of the game,
bringing in Simonson, whose tally tied the score;
the homer putting Fairview one run ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em! They&rsquo;re easy fruit!&rdquo;
yelled the Fairview throng, the girls from the
college blending their shrill voices with those of
their male companions. Tom was rather shaky
when he and Dutch held a little consultation in
front of home plate, as Puder walked up with his
stick. Puder singled, and Tom was getting worried,
but he managed to pull himself together,
and struck out Sellig and Sullivan, killing Puder
on second, and halting any further scoring by
Fairview that inning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better put Rod Evert in the box
in my place,&rdquo; suggested Tom to Mr. Leighton,
as the Randall nine, much dispirited, came up for
their turn at the bat, the score being four to
three in favor of Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the coach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do
all right, Tom. This is only a little slump.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>hope</i> this is the end of it,&rdquo; remarked the
pitcher. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand much more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll duplicate Felton&rsquo;s home run,&rdquo; promised
Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk,&rdquo; declared Ed Kerr,
who was not feeling very happy over the showing
made by the team of which he was manager.</p>

<p>But alas for Dutch&rsquo;s hope! He didn&rsquo;t get a
chance to bat, for Woodhouse struck out, and
Molloy and Pete Backus followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can hold &rsquo;em this inning, and then get
two runs, it will do the trick,&rdquo; remarked Holly
Cross at the beginning of the ninth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; spoke Tom dubiously, for he was beginning
to lose heart. However, he gritted his
teeth and, after a few warming-up balls before
Ned Williams came up, he pitched to such good
advantage that Williams was out in record time.
John Allen swiped savagely at the horsehide, but
it was not to be, and he walked back to the bench,
while Bower came out, a smile of confidence on
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another home run,&rdquo; he prophesied, but
Tom, in his heart, decided it was not to be, nor
was it, for Bower struck out. This still left the
score four to three, in favor of Fairview at the
ending of the first half of the ninth inning. Randall
needed two runs to win, but one would tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the tally, and give them another chance. It would
also afford another opportunity for Fairview.</p>

<p>The big crowd was on edge. Songs and college
cries were being hurled back and forth from
grand stand and bleachers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song, fellows,&rdquo; yelled
Bean Perkins, and the strains of &ldquo;<i>Aut Vincere
Aut Mori!</i>&rdquo; sung in Latin, welled sweetly and
solemnly over the diamond. Tom Parsons felt
the tears coming into his eyes, as he walked in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we only can win!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>

<p>He was up first, and he almost trembled as he
faced the Fairview pitcher. There was a mist
in his eyes, but somehow he managed to see
through it the ball that was coming swiftly toward
him. It looked good to his practiced eye, and he
swung at it with all his force. To his delight
there followed that most delightful of sounds, the
&ldquo;ping,&rdquo; as the tough mushroom bat met the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh! A pretty hit! A beaut!&rdquo; Tom
heard the crowd yell, as he tossed aside the club,
and started for first like a deer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo; yelled Holly Cross. &ldquo;Keep
a-going, Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom kept on, swung wide around first, and
then legged it for second. The ball had gone
well over the center fielder&rsquo;s head, and he was
running back toward the daisies after it. &ldquo;Go
on! Go on!&rdquo; implored Holly. Tom reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
third before the ball was fielded in, and he remained
there panting, while Joe Jackson took his
place at home plate, swaying his bat to and fro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None gone, Tom on third and Joe at bat,&rdquo;
mused Mr. Leighton. &ldquo;I wish Joe was a better
hitter, but maybe he can knock out a bingle that
will do the trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe did, though it was more through an error
on the part of the second baseman, who muffed
the fly, than any ability on Joe&rsquo;s part, that the
Jersey twin got to first.</p>

<p>Tom came in, amid a burst of cheers and yells,
scoring the tying run. Would there be a winning
one, or would ten innings be necessary?</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson struck out, while his friends
groaned, but Joe, with desperate daring, managed
to steal second. Then up came Dutch Housenlager,
and when he hit the ball a resounding
whack the heart of more than one lad was in
his throat. But, by a desperate run, the left
fielder caught the fly, and Dutch was out, while
Joe Jackson was on third. He died there, for
Phil, to his great chagrin, struck out. The score
stood a tie 4 to 4.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten innings! Ten innings!&rdquo; yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>Bean Perkins and his fellows were singing all
the songs they knew. So were the Fairview cohorts,
and the scene was a wild one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em down, Tom; hold &rsquo;em down!&rdquo; implored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the coach as the plucky pitcher went to his
box.</p>

<p>It looked as if he was not going to do it, for
he passed Sam Soden to first, and duplicated the
trick for Charley Simonson and with two men on
bases, not a man down, and Tom as nervous as
a cat, it began to look dubious for Randall. The
crowd was on edge. So was Tom, with two lively
runners on the first and second bags to watch.
Several times he threw to first, hoping to catch
Simonson napping, but it was not to be.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pete Backus, who was holding down
second base, threw up his hand to shield his eyes,
and Tom saw a dazzling streak of light flash
across from the grand stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Pete?&rdquo; asked the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some girl up there must have bright buttons
on, or a hat pin made of diamonds, for they&rsquo;re
flashing in my eyes,&rdquo; complained Pete. Then the
flash vanished and Tom was about to pitch a ball
for Ed Felton, who was up, when, as he gave a
comprehensive look at first and second, he again
saw the dazzling gleam in Pete&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stop that!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Kerr or Mr. Leighton to speak to
whoever&rsquo;s wearing such bright adornments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny it should hit me in the eyes all the
while,&rdquo; complained Pete, changing his position,
but the beam of light followed him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s doing that on purpose,&rdquo; declared
Tom, and he fairly ran toward the grand stand.
But before he got there he saw something happening.</p>

<p>The beam of light came from that section of
the stand near where Tom had noticed Langridge
and Miss Harrison sitting. Then, as he raced on,
he also remembered that Sid sat there too. A
terrible thought came to him. Could Sid be trying
to disconcert the player who was taking his
place, by flashing a mirror in his eyes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t do such a dirty trick!&rdquo;
said Tom to himself, a moment after he had
entertained the thought.</p>

<p>The captain reached the stand, in company with
Dutch, who had run back in response to the
pitcher&rsquo;s motion, in time to see Sid leap to his feet,
reach forward toward Langridge, who sat in
front of him, while the deposed second baseman
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean sneak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Langridge coolly,
as he turned an insolent stare on Sid. &ldquo;Mad because
I&rsquo;m with Miss Harrison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you cur! But I see what you&rsquo;re doing!
Hand over that mirror!&rdquo; and before Langridge
could protest Sid had yanked him backward,
partly over the seat, and had grasped the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
hand of the former Randall student&mdash;a hand containing
a small, circular mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were flashing that in the eyes of our second
baseman, you sneak!&rdquo; cried Sid hotly. &ldquo;I
was watching you! You held it down, where you
thought no one would see. You ought to be
kicked off the stand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; declared Langridge brazenly, yet
there was fear in his manner, and the mirror was
mute evidence. &ldquo;I was just going to hand it to
Miss Harrison,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;To let her see
if her hat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl turned her blue eyes on him, and
shrank away from the notice attracted to her
escort. Langridge did not complete his lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw what you were doing,&rdquo; went on Sid.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t something flashing in Pete&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo; he
asked, as Tom and Dutch, with some of the
other Randall players, stood on the ground, in
front of where the scene had taken place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I came in to see about,&rdquo; declared
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know it was shining in his eyes,&rdquo;
stammered Langridge. &ldquo;Let go of me, Henderson,
or I&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid did not want to make a scene, and released
his hold of Langridge. Tom, by a motion, signalled
to Sid to say nothing more, but it was principally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
on the score of not wanting to further
subject Miss Harrison to embarrassment, rather
than to save Langridge from punishment. Then,
too, there was only slim proof against Langridge.
Sid grabbed the mirror away from the bully, and
the latter dared not protest. There were some
hisses, and Miss Harrison blushed painfully.
Langridge tried to brazen it out, but, with a muttered
excuse that he wanted to get a cigar, he left
the stand, and the blue-eyed girl, after a frightened
glance around, went and sat with Ruth and
Madge. Sid looked as if he wanted to follow
her, but he did not dare, and after Tom, Ed Kerr
and Mr. Leighton had consulted together for a
few minutes, it was agreed to take no action
against Langridge, who had sneaked off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did it, all right,&rdquo; decided Tom. &ldquo;He
wanted to rattle Pete and make us lose to Fairview,
but we&rsquo;re not going to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed not,&rdquo; asserted the coach. &ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em
down now, Tom. One run will do the trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two men on bases, and none out
when Ed Felton resumed his place at home, and
Tom was inclined to shiver when he remembered
what Ed had done to the ball before. But the
pitcher took a strong brace, and struck out Ed,
much to that worthy&rsquo;s surprise.</p>

<p>Then, by some magnificent pitching, in the face
of long odds, Tom retired Puder and Lem Sellig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with an ease that he himself marveled at. His
arm seemed to have gotten back some of its cunning.</p>

<p>A zero went up in the tenth frame for Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks good to me!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross,
dancing about. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t get in one run now,
Tom, we ought to be put out of the league.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s up to you, Holly,&rdquo; remarked Tom.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you&rsquo;ll not be ashamed of me!&rdquo; declared
the big center fielder.</p>

<p>He rapped out a nice bingle that took him to
second base. Then came Dan Woodhouse, and
he struck out, amid groans.</p>

<p>Bricktop walked up with an air of confidence,
amid encouraging comments from his chums. The
Fairview pitcher was getting a little rattled, and
threw so wild that the catcher, though he jumped
for the ball, missed it, and had to run back while
Holly, who had stolen to third, came in with a
rush. There was a mixup at the plate, as Holly
slid in, accompanied by a cloud of dust, but the
pitcher, who had run up to assist the catcher, and
make amends for his wild throw, dropped the
ball, and Holly scored the winning run.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence until the big
crowd and the players appreciated what it meant
to pull out a victory in the tenth, and that after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
an exceedingly close game. Then came a burst
of cheers, and applause that made the grand
stands and bleachers rattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Wow! Wow!&rdquo; yelled the exultant Randallites,
and they capered about in very joy, like
wild Indians, slapping each other on the back,
punching and being punched, cheering for themselves
and for Fairview by turns.</p>

<h3>SID DESPAIRS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it great!&rdquo; demanded Dutch Housenlager,
as he waltzed up to Tom, and tried to lead
him out into a dance on the diamond. &ldquo;Immense,
eh? Pulling it out of the fire that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what we did&mdash;pulled it out of the
fire,&rdquo; agreed Tom, with a smile. &ldquo;We needed
this victory, and I&rsquo;m glad we won, but we&rsquo;ve got
to play better&mdash;and that includes me&mdash;if we&rsquo;re to
have the loving cup this year. Our batting and
fielding could be improved a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; agreed Dutch, &ldquo;but aren&rsquo;t you
a bit proud of us, captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure&mdash;of course,&rdquo; answered the pitcher
heartily. &ldquo;Let joy be unconfined,&rdquo; and with a
yell of pure enjoyment he joined in the impromptu
dance.</p>

<p>Fairview was glum, but not cast down. They
had cheered the winning team, and Ted Puder,
the captain, came up to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly beat us fair and square,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
acknowledged. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think we had
anything to do with Langridge using that mirror
to dazzle the eyes of your second baseman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never thought of such a thing,&rdquo; declared Tom
with emphasis. &ldquo;The cad worked that trick up
all by his lonesome. I guess he thought maybe
Sid was playing there, and he has a grudge against
Henderson&mdash;yet that couldn&rsquo;t have been it either,
for Langridge knows Sid is suspended, and anyhow,
Sid was sitting directly back of the sneak,
where Langridge could have seen him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a good thing Sid detected him. Well,
we&rsquo;ll beat you next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; advised Tom with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, cap,&rdquo; called Phil to him a moment
later. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look up Sid, and, incidentally, the
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed the pitcher, and a moment later
he and Phil were greeting Madge, Ruth and
Mabel. But Sid had hurried away.</p>

<p>The little group strolled past the grand stand,
Tom and Phil excusing themselves while they
went in to get on their street garments, the girls
promising to wait for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder where Sid went?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; replied Phil. &ldquo;Langridge lit out,
too; the cad! What a chump he must be to think
he could get away with a game like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was almost as good to have Sid discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
him trying it, as if our old chum had held
down the second bag,&rdquo; declared the captain. &ldquo;A
flash at the right moment would have confused
Pete, and might have cost us the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Come on, hurry up, or the girls
will get tired of waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two went out, in time to see Langridge
approaching the three young ladies. The Boxer
Hall pitcher was striding over the grass toward
Miss Harrison, who stood a little apart from her
two friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to have kept you waiting,
Miss Mabel,&rdquo; began Langridge. &ldquo;The truth was,
I had an important engagement, that I came near
forgetting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t kept me waiting,&rdquo; was the cool
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? Well, I&rsquo;m glad of it. Now, if you&rsquo;re
ready we&rsquo;ll trot along. I met a friend of mine,
Mr. Bascome, of Randall, and he will take us
back to Fairview in his auto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t care to go,&rdquo; replied Miss
Harrison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Don&rsquo;t you like rides in the gasolene
gig?&rdquo; asked Langridge, with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t exactly mean that,&rdquo; went on Miss
Harrison. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the company I object to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Bascome? Why he&rsquo;s all right.
Maybe he&rsquo;s a little too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean you!&rdquo; burst out the girl, flashing a
look of scorn on him from her blue eyes. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care to ride with a person who seeks to take
unfair advantage of another in a ball game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that mirror? That was all an
accident&mdash;I assure you it was. I didn&rsquo;t intend
anything&mdash;honestly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will favor me by not speaking to me
again!&rdquo; came in snapping tones from the indignant
girl. &ldquo;I shall refuse to recognize you after
this, Mr. Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I say now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested the bully,
as he took a step forward. But Mabel linked her
arm in that of Ruth, and, as Tom and Phil came
along just then, Langridge, who was aware that
they had heard the foregoing conversation, slipped
hastily away, with a very red face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have kept you waiting,&rdquo; began Tom,
unconsciously repeating the remark of Langridge.
Miss Harrison seemed a little ill at ease, and Phil
blurted out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on! Let&rsquo;s hurry, or there won&rsquo;t
be any ice cream left at Anderson&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a hot
day and the crowd must be dry as a bone. I
know I am. Come on, girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had a merry little time, until it was necessary
for the girls to return to Fairview, whither
Tom and Phil escorted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say any more to Langridge, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
man?&rdquo; asked Tom of Sid, that night in the room
of the &ldquo;inseparables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have heard Miss Harrison lay
him out,&rdquo; exulted Phil. &ldquo;She certainly put it all
over him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Sid eagerly, and his chums
took turns telling him how the blue-eyed girl had
given Langridge his &ldquo;walking papers&rdquo; in a manner
very distasteful to that individual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid joyfully.
Then, as a look came into his eyes that
his chums had not seen there since the first happy
days he had experienced with Mabel Harrison,
Sid went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the date of the Junior racket?
I&rsquo;ve mislaid my tickets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Tom mischievously, though he
well knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your affair,&rdquo; retorted Sid, but there
was no sting in his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s next Friday,&rdquo; put in Phil.</p>

<p>Sid tossed aside the things on his desk, and
made a great fuss about writing a letter, while
Phil and Tom casually looked on, well knowing
to whom the epistle was addressed. Sid made
several false starts, and destroyed enough paper
to have enabled him to compute several problems
and tore up a lot of envelopes before he finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
something that met with his approval, and then
he went out to post it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asked Miss Harrison to go to the Junior
affair with him,&rdquo; said Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;I hope she goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid lived in an atmosphere of rosy hope for
several days, but, when no reply came, he began
to get uneasy. He eagerly accepted an invitation
extended to him a few days later, to accompany
Phil and Tom on a trip to Fairview, Ruth again
having asked her brother to call to talk about
the proposed trip to Europe. The three chums
found the three girls in the reception room, and
Miss Harrison showed some embarrassment when
Sid entered. With a view to dispelling it Ruth,
with a rapid signal to her brother, Tom and
Madge, left the room, they following, leaving
Miss Harrison and Sid alone there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely weather,&rdquo; remarked Sid desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; answered Miss Harrison, uncertain
whether to be amused or angry at the trick played
on her by her chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the Junior dance Friday
night?&rdquo; went on Sid. &ldquo;I wrote and asked you&mdash;you
got my letter, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Henderson, and I should have answered
before, but I was uncertain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me take you?&rdquo; pleaded Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like&mdash;won&rsquo;t you&mdash;can you explain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
certain matter which I wish to know about?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;You know what I mean. Believe me,
I&rsquo;m not prudish, or anything like that, but&mdash;if you
only knew how I feel about it&mdash;won&rsquo;t you tell me
about that&mdash;that item in the paper accusing you?&rdquo;
she stammered. &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t there, why can&rsquo;t
you say so?&rdquo; and she leaned eagerly forward,
looking Sid full in the face.</p>

<p>He scarcely seemed to breathe. There was a
great struggle going on within him. He looked
into the blue eyes of the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;yet,&rdquo; he said brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t go with you to the dance,&rdquo; she
replied in a low voice, and she turned and left
the room, going back to the den she shared with
Ruth and Madge, while Sid went out the front
door, and across the campus; nor would he stay,
though Phil and Tom called to him, but walked
off, black despair in his heart.</p>

<h3>FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES</h3>


<p>Tom and Phil went to the Junior dance, taking
Madge and Ruth, and, though they enjoyed it
thoroughly, there was a little sorrow in the hearts
of the two lads that Sid was not there to share
the pleasure with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he didn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo; asked Phil
of Ruth, as the four stood chatting about his absence,
over an ice, during an intermission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be able to guess,&rdquo; replied his
sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; persisted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because a certain person with blue eyes
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Phil would have
blurted out the name, had not Miss Tyler laid a
pretty hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; cautioned Madge. &ldquo;No names out
in company, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom comprehendingly.
&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather miserable,&rdquo; answered Ruth. &ldquo;She
wouldn&rsquo;t come with us, though we knew you boys
wouldn&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; spoke Phil quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she stayed there in the room, moping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Phil, and again the
pretty fingers spread themselves across his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; resumed Tom. &ldquo;If he only
would explain then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then everything would be all right,&rdquo; finished
Ruth. &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t. Talk about women having
a mind of their own, and being stubborn! I
know a certain young man very much that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t talk so about him,&rdquo; expostulated
Phil. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right. There&rsquo;s something
queer at the bottom of it, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
to learn that Langridge had had a hand
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I never thought of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right. I wonder if we
could do anything to help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not meddle,&rdquo; cautioned Ruth. &ldquo;Madge
and I tried to use our influence, and were roundly
snubbed for our pains. It&rsquo;s too bad, but maybe
things will come right after a while. Oh, there&rsquo;s
a lovely waltz! Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly grand!&rdquo; and
her eyes sparkled in anticipation as Tom led her
out on the floor while the music welled forth in
dreamy strains.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Back in the &ldquo;den of the inseparables&rdquo; Sid sat
in gloomy loneliness, making a pretense of studying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; he cried at length, as he
flung the book from him, knocking down the alarm
clock in its flight. &ldquo;What is the use? I might as
well give up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as he noted the cessation of the fussy
ticking of the timepiece he crossed to where it lay
on the ragged rug, and picked it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope it isn&rsquo;t damaged,&rdquo; he murmured contritely.
He shook it vigorously, and the ticking
resumed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he added, with a breath
of relief, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t hurt it with an axe. Guess
I might as well turn in. But I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
paused, shrugged his shoulders helplessly, and did
not finish.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door, and Sid
started. He flung open the portal, and Wallops,
the messenger, stood in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A note for you, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;A fellow just brought it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid snatched it eagerly, a hopeful look showing
on his face. Then, as he saw the writing, there
seemed to come into his eyes a shadow of fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Wallops,&rdquo; he replied kindly, and
he closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, will this never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
end? Must I carry this secret all through college?&rdquo;
and he tore the note to bits. Then he
slipped on another coat, pulled a cap down over
his eyes and went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Sid isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, when
he and Tom, bubbling over still, with the spirit
of the dance, came back to their apartment, after
having escorted the girls home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the pitcher, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s
not allowed any more passes since that affair
with the pocket flask. He&rsquo;s taking chances to slip
out. Zane will be almost sure to catch him, and
a few turns like that and Sid will be expelled. I
wonder what&rsquo;s gotten into him lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; responded Phil. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope
that he won&rsquo;t be nabbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a vain hope, for Sid, coming into college
about three o&rsquo;clock that morning, was detected
by the proctor. There was quite a stir
over it, and Sid came mighty near expulsion.
Only his fine scholarship saved him, but he was
warned that another offense would be fatal to his
chances.</p>

<p>Sid said nothing to his chums, but maintained
a gloomy reserve, which wore off in a few days,
but still left a cloud between them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom was kept busy with his studies
and his interest in the nine, while Phil was &ldquo;boning&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
away, seeking a scholarship prize, and devoting
as much time as he could to practice on
the diamond.</p>

<p>Sid, barred from participation in regular games,
was, however, allowed to practice with the &rsquo;varsity,
and play on the scrub as suited his fancy,
and Tom was glad to have him do either, for he
cherished a secret hope that the ban might be
removed before the end of the term, and he
wanted Sid to keep in form. As for the second
baseman he was becoming a &ldquo;crackerjack&rdquo; wielder
of the stick, and at either right or left hand work
was an example to be looked up to by the younger
players, and his average something to be sighed
after.</p>

<p>It happened one afternoon, a few days prior
to an important out-of-town game Tom&rsquo;s nine was
to play, that the captain came upon Ed Kerr, the
manager, busy figuring, in a corner of the gymnasium,
his brow as wrinkled as a washboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;Conic sections
or a problem in trig, Ed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a problem in finance,&rdquo; was the response.
&ldquo;Ferd Snowden, the treasurer, has just handed
me a statement of how the nine&rsquo;s finances are,
and, for the life of me I can&rsquo;t see how it happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shortage.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shortage?&rdquo; and there was a frightened note
in Tom&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, shortage. I thought we were running
along pretty well, but according to Snowden we&rsquo;re
in debt to him about ten dollars, for money he&rsquo;s
advanced from his own pocket. He says he can&rsquo;t
afford any more, and&mdash;well, it means we can&rsquo;t
play Richfield Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we haven&rsquo;t money enough to take the
team out of town, and back again. Besides, Dutch
needs a new catching mitt. I don&rsquo;t see how it
happened. I thought we were making money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I. Let&rsquo;s go have a talk with Snowden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The treasurer of the nine could only confirm
his statement. He showed by figures that the
amount of money taken in had not met the expenses,
so far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crowds haven&rsquo;t been what they ought to
have been,&rdquo; Snowden explained. &ldquo;Randall isn&rsquo;t
drawing as it used to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing better ball,&rdquo; fired Tom at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be. I&rsquo;m only talking from a money
standpoint. We&rsquo;re in debt ten dollars. Not that
I mind, for I don&rsquo;t need the money, but I thought
Kerr ought to know. I can&rsquo;t advance any more,
and the team can&rsquo;t go to Richfield without cash
for railroad fare.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Tom, scratching his
head. &ldquo;Well, the only thing to do is to call a
meeting and ask for subscriptions. The fellows
will easily make up the deficit, and give enough
over to provide for traveling expenses. Dutch
can use his old glove for a few games yet, and we
ought to get enough out of this Richfield game
to put us on our feet. After that we have a number
of contests that will draw big crowds. Then
comes the final whack at Boxer Hall, and that is
always a money-maker. We&rsquo;ll come out right yet,
Ed. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, only it looks as if I hadn&rsquo;t managed
things right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Of course you have. The fellows
will go down in their pockets. I&rsquo;ll call a meeting
for this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>PITCHFORK&rsquo;S TALL HAT</h3>


<p>There was a buzz of excitement among the
college students when the notice had been read,
calling for a meeting of the athletic committee,
to straighten out a financial tangle. There were
various comments, and, though some remarked
that it was &ldquo;always that way,&rdquo; and that a &ldquo;few
fellows had to be depended on for the money,&rdquo;
and like sentiments, the majority of opinion was
that the sum needed would quickly be subscribed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they make the ball nine a stock
concern?&rdquo; asked Mort Eddington, whose father
was an &ldquo;operator&rdquo; in Wall street. &ldquo;If they sold
stock, lots of fellows would be glad to buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, considering that the nine has made a
barrel of money every year, it would be a paying
proposition,&rdquo; added Holly Cross. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t
do business that way, Eddington, as you&rsquo;ll learn
when you&rsquo;ve been here more than one term. What
money we have left over at the end of the season
goes to help some college club, or a team that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hasn&rsquo;t done so well. We&rsquo;re not stock jobbers in
Randall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be glad of
some money you could have from selling stock,
before you&rsquo;re through,&rdquo; sneered the &ldquo;operator&rsquo;s&rdquo;
son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not,&rdquo; responded Dutch. &ldquo;The
fellows will toe the mark with the rocks all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle says it&rsquo;s all in how a team is managed,&rdquo;
began a voice, and Ford Fenton strolled
up. &ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of here, you shrimp!&rdquo; cried Holly
Cross, making a rush at Ford. &ldquo;If your uncle
heard you, he&rsquo;d take you out of this college for
disgracing him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Dutch, making a playful
attempt to trip up Ford, which the much-uncled
youth skillfully avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, just the same,&rdquo; declared Bert
Bascome, who came up at that juncture. &ldquo;The
team hasn&rsquo;t been managed right, and I&rsquo;m going
to have something to say about it at the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The session called by Tom to consider financial
matters was well attended. Tom, by general consent,
was made chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all know what we&rsquo;re here for,&rdquo; began
the captain, who was not fond of long speeches.
&ldquo;The nine needs money to help it out of a hole.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who got it in the hole?&rdquo; asked Bascome with
a sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went Tom&rsquo;s gavel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a chance to speak when the time
comes,&rdquo; said the pitcher sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be through
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bascome sat down, muttering something about
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; and &ldquo;money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need cash,&rdquo; went on Tom, &ldquo;to carry us
over a certain period. After that we&rsquo;ll have
plenty. We haven&rsquo;t made as much as we expected.
Now we&rsquo;d like subscriptions, and if any
fellow feels that he can&rsquo;t afford to give the money
outright, don&rsquo;t let that stand in his way. We&rsquo;ll
only borrow it, and pay it back at the end of the
season. Of course, if any one wants to give it
without any strings on it, so much the better.
I&rsquo;ve got ten dollars that goes that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me down for fifteen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got five that isn&rsquo;t working!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were some of the cries that greeted
Tom&rsquo;s closing words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the treasurer take it,&rdquo; announced the
chairman. &ldquo;Get busy, Snowden. We&rsquo;ve got
enough now to take the team out of town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil, who was sitting near Sid, looked at his
chum, and remarked:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to help us out, aren&rsquo;t you, Sid?
Seems to me I saw you with a fair-sized roll yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to help, first rate,&rdquo; answered Sid,
in some confusion, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m broke now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil did not reply, but there was a queer look
on his face. He was wondering what Sid had
done with his money. This was the second time
he had unexpectedly &ldquo;gone broke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Subscriptions were pouring in on Snowden, and
it began to look as if Tom&rsquo;s prophecy would hold
good, and that the boys only need be told of the
needs of the nine to have them attended to. Bert
Bascome, who had been whispering with Ford
Fenton, and some of his cronies, suddenly arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; began Bascome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bascome,&rdquo; responded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rise to a question of personal privilege,&rdquo; he
went on pompously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Tom, trying not to smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to know why it is that the nine
hasn&rsquo;t made money enough to carry itself so far
this season, when it has played a number of games,
and won several?&rdquo; went on Bascome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One reason is that the attendance was not
large enough to cover expenses, and leave a sufficiently
large sum to be divided between our team
and the ones we played,&rdquo; stated the captain, wondering
what Bascome was driving at.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to inquire if it is not because the
team was not properly managed?&rdquo; shot out Bascome.
&ldquo;I believe that if Ford Fenton had been
elected we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treason!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fresh! Fresh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A score of lads were on their feet, shouting,
yelling, demanding to be recognized, shaking their
fists at Bascome and uttering dire threats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, may I spake wan wurd!&rdquo;
cried Bricktop Molloy, in his excitement lapsing
into a rich brogue.</p>

<p>Tom was banging away with his gavel, but he
managed to make his voice heard above the tumult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bascome has the floor!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever heard of Bascome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the cries; again the banging of the gavel,
and at last Tom succeeded in producing quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bascome has the floor,&rdquo; the chairman
announced. &ldquo;Do I understand that you ask that
as a point of information?&rdquo; and Tom gazed at
the wealthy freshman, who, through all the tumult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
had maintained his place, sneeringly indifferent
to the threats made against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rdquo; he stated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the entire college answer that if necessary,&rdquo;
declared Tom. &ldquo;Mr. Bascome has asked
a question&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer him!&rdquo; yelled Dutch.</p>

<p>Bang! went the gavel. From his corner where
he had been seated, doing some figuring, Ed Kerr
arose&mdash;his face white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! A question of personal privilege!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; answered Tom, forgetting his parliamentary
language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to tender my resignation as manager of
the Randall baseball nine!&rdquo; cried Ed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him sit down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s haze Bascome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, will you be quiet?&rdquo; begged Tom. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t recognize anyone until you&rsquo;re quiet!&rdquo; and
he banged away.</p>

<p>Gradually there came a hush, while both Bascome
and Kerr remained on their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a question before the house,&rdquo; went
on the captain, &ldquo;and until that is settled I can&rsquo;t
listen to anything else. Mr. Bascome wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
know whether the present financial trouble of the
nine is not due to the manager. How do you
answer him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo; came in a great chorus.</p>

<p>Tom turned to Ed Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any who think otherwise?&rdquo; asked
the chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; called Bascome, and he was supported
by half a dozen, including Ford Fenton. There
were groans of protest, but Tom silenced them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Bascome has his answer,&rdquo; declared
the chairman. &ldquo;You have an almost overwhelming
vote of confidence, Mr. Manager, and
I congratulate you. Is there any further business
to come before the meeting. Oh, yes, I almost
forgot. How are you making out, Mr.
Treasurer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; cried Snowden. &ldquo;All we need and
more, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Then the meeting is adjourned. We
don&rsquo;t need any motion,&rdquo; and Tom started to leave
the little platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; blustered Bert Bascome, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
member of the athletic committee, and you can&rsquo;t
carry things in this high-handed manner. I move
that we go into executive session and consider the
election of a new manager. Mr. Kerr has resigned,
as I understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; advised Dutch Housenlager, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
he stretched out his foot, and skillfully tripped up
the noisy objector, who went down in a heap, with
Ford Fenton on top of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Quit! I&rsquo;ll have you expelled for that!&rdquo;
spluttered Bascome, rising and making a rush for
Dutch. But he was surrounded by a mass of students,
who laughed and joked with him, shoving
him from side to side until he was so mauled and
hauled and mistreated that he was glad to make
his escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little rat!&rdquo; muttered Holly Cross, as he saw
Bascome and Ford going off together. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all they&rsquo;re good for&mdash;to make trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Tom, &ldquo;Bascome&rsquo;s been sore ever
since he couldn&rsquo;t have his way about electing Ford
Fenton manager. But I guess we&rsquo;re out of the
woods now. Get in good shape for the Richfield
game Saturday, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd rushed from the gymnasium, laughing
and shouting, and refusing to listen to Kerr,
who still talked of resigning, though he was finally
shown that the objection to him amounted to nothing.
It was still light enough for some practice,
and most of the lads headed for the diamond.
Tom, Phil and Sid walked along together. As
they passed under the side window of the East
Dormitory, where the freshmen and seniors
roomed, Phil spied, hanging from a casement, a
tall, silk hat.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Get on to the tile!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Some blooming
freshman must have hung it there to air, ready
for a shindig to-night. Bet you can&rsquo;t hit it, Tom.
Two out of three. If you do I&rsquo;ll stand for sodas
for the bunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; agreed the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a ball,&rdquo; remarked Sid, handing Tom
one. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom fingered the horsehide, glanced critically
at the hat, which hung on a stick out of the window,
and then drew back his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; he cried, and, an instant later
the ball was whizzing through the air. Straight
as the proverbial arrow it went, and so skillfully
had Tom thrown, that the spheroid went right
into the hat&mdash;and, came out on the other side,
through the top of the crown, making a disastrous
rent. Then ball and hat came to the ground
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine shot!&rdquo; cried Phil admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That hat won&rsquo;t do duty to-night,&rdquo; observed
Sid. &ldquo;You knocked the top clean out, Tom,&rdquo; and
he ran forward to pick it up. As he did so he
was aware of an indignant figure coming from
the dormitory. So, in fact, were Phil and Tom.
A moment later, as Sid held the ruined silk hat in
his hands, Professor Emerson Tines confronted
the lads.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask what you young gentlemen are
doing with my hat?&rdquo; he asked in frigid tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;your hat?&rdquo; stammered Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hat,&rdquo; repeated the stern teacher. &ldquo;I was
a witness to your act of vandalism. You may
come with me to Dr. Churchill at once!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<h3>A PETITION</h3>


<p>Phil, Tom and Sid stood staring blankly at
one another. Sid still held the broken hat, until
Professor Tines came up and took it from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruined, utterly ruined!&rdquo; murmured the
teacher. &ldquo;My best hat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;I&mdash;that is I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know it was your
hat,&rdquo; stammered Tom. &ldquo;I threw the ball through
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know it was my hat?&rdquo; asked Professor
Tines, as if such ignorance was inexcusable.
&ldquo;Whose did you suppose it was, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some galoot&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean some freshman&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
stammered Phil. &ldquo;You see, it was hanging from
a window in the freshmen&rsquo;s dormitory, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not hanging from the window of any
student in the first year class,&rdquo; declared the instructor
pompously. &ldquo;I had sent my silk hat to
one of the janitors, who makes a practice of ironing
them. He had finished it, and hung it out
to air, when you&mdash;you vandals came along. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
distinctly saw you throw at my hat, sir,&rdquo; and Professor
Tines shook his finger at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I know it, sir. I admit it,&rdquo; confessed the
captain. &ldquo;Only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know it was your hat, sir,&rdquo; went
on Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s quite&mdash;quite unfit to wear,
sir,&rdquo; and Sid tried to put the flapping piece back
into place, for the professor had dropped the tile,
and Sid had picked it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfit to wear! I should say it was. Fit to
wear! Why I intend delivering a lecture on &lsquo;The
Art of Repose as an Aid to High Thinking&rsquo; and
now, sir&mdash;now, you young vandals have ruined
the hat I was going to wear! It&rsquo;s infamous&mdash;infamous!
I shall have you expelled! I shall let
your parents know of your shameless conduct!
I shall have you dismissed at once!&rdquo; and the irate
professor shook his fist first at Tom, then at Sid
and then at Phil. &ldquo;Your conduct is a disgrace
to the school!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Here, give me my
hat!&rdquo; and he fairly snatched it from Sid. &ldquo;Come
with me at once to Dr. Churchill. He shall know
about this outrage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Professor Tines, we didn&rsquo;t
know it was your hat,&rdquo; was about all Phil could
think of to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the worse. You thought it belonged
to some defenseless student, and that you could
ruin it with impunity. But I shall soon show you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
how mistaken you were. Come with me at once!&rdquo;
and Professor Tines, holding his hat in one hand,
seized Tom&rsquo;s coat sleeve in the other, and led
him toward the president&rsquo;s office, followed by
Phil and Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have a tall hat, which I&rsquo;ll give you, until
you can have this one fixed,&rdquo; spoke Sid, as they
walked along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until I get this one fixed? It is beyond fixing!&rdquo;
declared Mr. Tines wrathfully.</p>

<p>Good Dr. Churchill looked pained when the
three culprits were ushered into his presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, sir! Look here!&rdquo; spluttered Professor
Tines, his voice fairly trembling as he
thrust the battered hat close to the president, who
was near-sighted. &ldquo;Just look at that, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Hum!&rdquo; murmured the doctor. &ldquo;Very
interesting, I should say. Very interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting?&rdquo; and Mr. Tines stood aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I presume you have been illustrating to
your class the effect of some explosive agent on
soft material. I should say it was a very complete
and convincing experiment&mdash;very complete,
convincing and interesting. I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Congratulate! Interesting experiment!&rdquo;
gasped the irate &ldquo;Pitchfork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was very well done. My, my! The
crown of the hat is almost completely gone. Almost
completely,&rdquo; murmured the doctor, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
interestedly at the dilapidated tile. &ldquo;What sort of
an explosive did you use, Professor Tines? I
trust your class took careful notes of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explosion!&rdquo; burst out Professor Tines, looking
as if he was likely to blow up himself. &ldquo;That
was no explosion, sir! My best hat was ruined
by a baseball in the hands of these vandals, sir!
I demand their expulsion at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baseball?&rdquo; queried Doctor Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I threw it, sir,&rdquo; declared Tom quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
very sorry. I did not know the hat belonged to
Professor Tines, and I will pay for it at once,&rdquo;
and the captain made a motion toward his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have the whole story,&rdquo; requested the
president, and Tom thought there was a twinkle
in his eyes. Professor Tines related most of it,
in his usual explosive fashion, and the lads could
only plead guilty. The owner of the hat ended
by a demand for their dismissal, and Dr. Churchill
said he would take the matter under advisement,
but there was that in his manner which gave
the culprits hope, and when he sent for them a
little later, it was to pass the sentence that the
three of them must go shares in buying a new hat.
Tom wanted to stand all the damage, but Dr.
Churchill, with a half-laugh, said he must mete
out punishment all around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, will you lend me my share of the money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
for a few days?&rdquo; asked Sid, of Tom, when they
were on their way back to the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Say, what do you
do with all your cash, Sid?&rdquo; for Mr. Henderson
was known to be well off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;Oh, I have uses for it,&rdquo; replied Sid,
and he hurriedly turned the conversation.</p>

<p>The nine played Richfield, a strong college
team, on Saturday, and was nearly beaten, for just
when some good hitting was needed, Pete Backus,
who was filling Sid&rsquo;s place, went to the bad. Randall
did manage to get the lead of a run, and kept
it, due mainly to Tom&rsquo;s magnificent pitching, but
the final score was nothing to boast of, though
Randall came home winners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We certainly do miss Sid,&rdquo; remarked Tom, as
he was sitting beside Phil, in the train on the way
back. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s going to make
us win or lose the championship this year it&rsquo;s
batting, and that&rsquo;s Sid&rsquo;s strong point. I wish we
could get him back on the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By getting up a petition, and having all the
fellows sign it. Maybe if the faculty understood
what it meant they would vote to rescind the order
not allowing Sid to take part in games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s worth trying!&rdquo; cried Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it! I&rsquo;ll go talk with Ed Kerr and
Mr. Leighton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The manager and coach thought the plan a
good one, and a few days later a petition was
quietly circulated. Nothing was said to Sid about
it, for fear he would object. The students were
anxious to get their names down, and soon there
was an imposing list.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to get the freshmen now,&rdquo; decided
Tom, one afternoon, when the petition was nearly
ready for presentation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making a class
affair of it, each year&rsquo;s students by themselves,
and I let the freshmen go until last. I&rsquo;ll see
Bascome, who is the class president, ask him to
call a meeting, and have his fellows sign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom sought out Bascome a little later, and
explained what was wanted, asking the freshman
to call a session of his classmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words you want me and my friends
to help you out of a hole?&rdquo; asked Bascome, and
he was sneering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; answered Tom, restraining
a desire to punch the overbearing freshman.
&ldquo;We want to strengthen the nine, and we can do
it if we can get Henderson back on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll never get him back with my signature
nor that of my friends!&rdquo; cried Bascome.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you fellows now, for the way
you&rsquo;ve treated me!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He was sneering openly. Tom looked him
full in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sneaking little cad,&rdquo; was what he said,
as he turned away.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h3>TOM STOPS A HOT ONE</h3>


<p>There was much excitement of a quiet sort
when it was known what stand Bascome had
taken. He was roundly condemned by the sophomores,
juniors and seniors, and even by a number
of the freshmen students. But Bascome remained
firm, and he carried the class with him.
Only a few freshmen put their names down on
the petition, and they resigned from the exclusive
freshman society to be able to do so.</p>

<p>For there was, that year in Randall, a somewhat
bitter feeling on the part of the whole
freshman class against the sophomores, on account
of some severe hazing in the fall. It had
created trouble, had engendered a sense of injury,
and there was lacking a proper spirit in
the college.</p>

<p>This had its effect, and the freshmen were
almost a unit against the nine, which (and this
was perhaps unusual) happened to be composed
mainly of sophomores that season.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the dirty sneak?&rdquo; asked
Tom of Phil, to whom he narrated the refusal
of Bascome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of it? I&rsquo;d be ashamed to properly
express myself, Tom. It&rsquo;s rotten, that&rsquo;s what it
is. But I guess we&rsquo;ve got enough names as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope so, anyhow. I&rsquo;m going to send it in,
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The petition was duly delivered to Dr. Churchill,
and a faculty meeting was called. A unanimous
vote of the corps of instructors was needed
to reinstate a student suspended from athletics
for a violation of the rules, such as Sid had been
accused of, this being one of the fundamental
laws of the college since its inception. Now the
absence of the names of the majority of the
freshman class tended to operate against the petition
being accorded an unprejudiced hearing,
but what did more to keep Sid out was the vote
of Professor Tines.</p>

<p>The latter could not get over the destruction
of his silk hat, though a new one had been purchased
for him, and when the final vote was
taken he barred Sid from getting back on the
nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reason to believe that Mr. Henderson
is inclined to too much horse-play,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
indicated by what he did to my hat. Again, if
he were a popular student the freshmen would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
have joined in the request. They did not, as a
class, and so I am constrained to vote as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the faculty&mdash;even Professor Tines&mdash;knew
the real reason why the freshmen names
were not down, and no one cared about mentioning
it, for it was not a thing for students to
discuss with the teachers. Mr. Leighton did his
best, in a delicate way, but it was of no use. The
petition failed, and not a few members of the
faculty were deeply grieved, for they wanted to
see a championship nine in Randall. Still they
would not argue with Professor Tines.</p>

<p>And the chances of Randall winning the championship
and the loving cup seemed to be diminishing
from day to day, in spite of the strenuous
efforts of Tom, Ed Kerr and Mr. Leighton.
There was something lacking. No one could
just say what it was, but there was a spirit of
uncertainty, and a sense of worriment in the
nine, that did not operate for perfect team work.</p>

<p>Tom threatened and pleaded by turns, but his
words had little effect. The men showed up well
in practice, and played a fast and snappy game
with the scrub, but when it came to going out on
the diamond there was a lack of batting ability
and an absence of team work, that had a bad
effect, and several games were won only by narrow
margins, while some, that should have been
won, were lost.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We play Boxer Hall, Saturday,&rdquo; observed
Tom, in his room with Phil and Sid one evening.
&ldquo;I wonder how we&rsquo;ll make out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the last game, is it?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s one more, and another with Fairview.
But I&rsquo;m not worrying much about the
co-eds. It&rsquo;s Boxer that has me guessing. Oh,
Sid, but I wish you were with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; and Sid turned his face aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get back?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you go to Dr. Churchill, and explain&mdash;about that
bottle of liquor&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Sid gently, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nine may lose,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m just as sorry as you are, Tom,&rdquo;
said the second baseman earnestly, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s out
of the question. I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;just yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you ever?&rdquo; demanded Phil eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;soon now. I am hoping every
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you given a&mdash;a sort of promise&mdash;to
some one?&rdquo; asked Tom gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Sid in a low voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
promise, and a great deal depends on it&mdash;even
more than the championship of Randall college.&rdquo;
And that was all Sid would say for the time
being.</p>

<p>The game with Boxer Hall was a hard one.
Tom and his men had to work for everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
they got, for Langridge seemed to have improved
in his pitching, and the fielding of Randall&rsquo;s
enemy was a thing to rejoice the heart of her
captain and coach.</p>

<p>The game ran along to the seventh inning
with some sensational plays, and the score was
6 to 4 in favor of Boxer. Then Langridge grew
a bit wild, and issued several passes until the
bases were full, when a three bagger which Holly
Cross knocked brought in three runs, and put
Randall one ahead. There was wild delight
then, and as none were out it looked as if Randall
would be good for at least two more runs.
But Langridge got control of the ball, and struck
out three men, and the next inning Boxer put in
a new pitcher&mdash;a semi-professional it was whispered,
though Tom and his fellows decided to
take no notice of the talk.</p>

<p>Then began a desperate effort on the part of
Boxer Hall to get in two more runs in the remaining
two innings. They adopted unfair tactics,
and several times the umpire warned the
men on the coaching line that they were violating
the rules.</p>

<p>Tom managed to stiffen his work in the eighth,
and, though two men got walking papers, no runs
came in, for the next three batters went down
and out under the influence of Tom&rsquo;s curves.
But that inning saw no runs for Randall, either,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and when her men came in for their last chance
Tom pleaded with them to get at least one more
to clinch the victory that was held by such a
narrow margin. It was not to be, however, and
a zero went up in the Randall space on the score
board.</p>

<p>The score was 7 to 6, in favor of Randall,
when Boxer Hall came up for the ending of the
ninth inning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can only hold &rsquo;em there,&rdquo; thought Tom
wearily, for his arm ached. Still he would not
give up, though Rod Evert was anxious to fill
the box.</p>

<p>Tom struck out the first man, gave the next
one a pass, and was hit for a single by the third
batter. Then the Randall captain knew he must
work hard to win. He struck out the next batter,
and as Dave Ogden, who followed, was a notoriously
hard hitter, Tom was worried. A three
bagger, which was Ogden&rsquo;s specialty, would bring
in two runs, and win the game for Boxer.</p>

<p>Dutch signalled for a drop, but Tom gave the
negative sign, and indicated that he would pitch
an out. As the ball left his fingers he was aware
that it had slipped and that Ogden would hit it.</p>

<p>He did. There was a resounding &ldquo;whack&rdquo;
and the ball, a hot liner, came straight for Tom.
The Boxer Hall crowd set up a yell, thinking
their man had made good, and that two runs, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
least, would come in. For no one expected to
see Tom stop the ball.</p>

<p>But he did. It was well over his head, and
passing him on the right side. <a href="#image03">He leaped into
the air, and with his bare hand caught the horsehide.</a>
The impact on his unprotected palm was
terrific, and he was at once aware that he had
split the skin. But though a pain, like a red hot
iron, shot down his arm, he held on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">

<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_232">HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WITH HIS BARE HAND

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Batter&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; cried the umpire. Then, amid
the wild and frenzied shouting of his chums, Tom
dropped the ball, and walked in, his arm hanging
limply by his side, while Dutch and Mr.
Leighton ran anxiously toward him.</p>

<p>But what did Tom Parsons care for an injured
hand? He had saved Randall from defeat, for
that ended Boxer&rsquo;s chances, two men died on
bases, and the game was over, the score being 7
to 6 in Randall&rsquo;s favor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<h3>GLOOMY DAYS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Much hurt?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Leighton anxiously,
as he reached Tom&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing to speak of,&rdquo; replied the plucky
pitcher carelessly, but when he held up his hand
a few drops of blood trickled from it, and there
was a thin, red line across the palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have stopped that ball!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dutch, half savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t? Do you think I was going to
stand there and let it go by, and lose us the
game?&rdquo; demanded Tom. &ldquo;I guess not&mdash;not for
two sore hands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s your pitching hand,&rdquo; expostulated
Dutch. &ldquo;We need you the rest of the season,
and the championship is far from won&mdash;in fact
it&rsquo;s almost as far off as the stars,&rdquo; he added in
a low voice, for he, too, had noted the lack of
team work in the present game, and some that
had preceded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be a croaker,&rdquo; advised Tom, trying
to speak lightly though he was in considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
pain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right in a week. We haven&rsquo;t
any hard game until then, and we&rsquo;ll go in and
clean up all the roosts around here before the
season closes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Leighton in a low
voice. &ldquo;You had better let the doctor look at
that hand, Parsons. No use taking any
chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The injury was temporarily bandaged and
Tom, with a queer feeling about him, that was
not at all connected with his wound, changed his
uniform for street clothing and returned to Randall
with the nine. Dr. Marshall, later, dressed
the hurt, and decided that Tom must refrain
from playing ball for at least a week&mdash;perhaps
longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Evert warming up all this week,&rdquo;
decided the coach. &ldquo;We play the Branchville
nine Saturday, and ought to win easily. Then I
think you&rsquo;ll be ready for Fairview the following
week, and Boxer Hall after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last two big games,&rdquo; murmured Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to win them both if we want the
championship, and I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheer up!&rdquo; advised Phil. &ldquo;I know I
played rotten to-day, but I&rsquo;ll do better next time.
Please forgive me?&rdquo; and he assumed a mocking,
contrite air, at which Tom could not help laughing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;You know
I wasn&rsquo;t referring to you. But, seriously, Phil,
something&rsquo;s got to be done. Think of it! We
pulled through by the skin of our teeth to-day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the skin of your hand, you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have it that way, but consider. Next
Saturday will be an easy contest. Then comes
Fairview and Boxer, both after our scalps. As
it stands now we have played a number of games
besides those with our two big enemies and are
tied with Boxer for first place, and the possession
of the loving cup. If we lose the Fairview game,
and Boxer beats Fairview we will still have a
show, by beating Boxer ourselves, but if it goes
the other way we&rsquo;re out of it. Our only hope
is to do up both Fairview and Boxer, in succession,
and how we are going to do it is more than
I can tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;somehow,&rdquo; declared Phil.</p>

<p>Matters, as regarded the baseball nine, did
not improve much in the next few days, and Tom
was filled with gloomy thoughts and dire forebodings.
Though he was on hand at every practice
the lads missed his sure arm in the pitching
box, though Evert did fairly well. The game
with Branchville proved fairly easy, though
Randall did not shine with any unusual brilliancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all, something&rsquo;s got to be done!&rdquo; declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Tom on the night after the game. He
was nervous and irritated, for his hand pained
him, though it was nearly healed, and he was
going to pitch in practice on Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be done?&rdquo; inquired Phil, who was
critically examining a new glove he had purchased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid, we might as well have it out,&rdquo; went on
Tom, and he squared his shoulders as if for a
fight, as he confronted the deposed second baseman.
&ldquo;Are you or are you not going to play
with us again this season? You know we need
you. We want you to help us to bat to win.
Are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t depend on me,&rdquo; answered Sid,
in apparent surprise. &ldquo;If the doctor says the
word I&rsquo;ll jump right in, and do my best. You
know that. It&rsquo;s up to the faculty. If they remove
the ban&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not up to the faculty!&rdquo; declared Tom
vigorously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, and you know it.
It&rsquo;s up to you to save the Randall &rsquo;varsity nine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to me?&rdquo; Sid had arisen from his seat
near the window, and stood in the middle of the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to you,&rdquo; repeated Tom. &ldquo;You know, as
well as I do, that you weren&rsquo;t guilty when Zane
caught you with the liquor. You had that for
some one else, and you&rsquo;re trying to shield him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
You never use it&mdash;you had no use for it, yet you
kept still when they accused you, and didn&rsquo;t tell.
Now it&rsquo;s time to tell&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to say you were
innocent&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to come out and end this mystery.
The team needs you! All you&rsquo;ve got to
do is to tell the truth, instead of keeping silent,
and you know the faculty will exonerate you.
Then the ban will be removed, and you can play.
That&rsquo;s why I say it&rsquo;s up to you. Isn&rsquo;t it now?
Own up, Sid; did you have that liquor for yourself?
If you told the truth about it couldn&rsquo;t you
get back on the team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was fairly panting from the force of his
appeal. Sid&rsquo;s face was strangely white, as he
turned to look the captain full in the eyes. For
a moment he did not reply, and the breathing of
the three chums could plainly be heard, for Phil
was as much agitated as either of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me, Sid,&rdquo; pleaded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer everything you ask,&rdquo; spoke
Sid, in a low voice. &ldquo;As I told you before, I
gave a promise, and, until I am released from
it, I can&rsquo;t speak&mdash;my lips are sealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t have that liquor for yourself,&rdquo;
persisted Tom. &ldquo;Did you, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to answer that,&rdquo; and Sid&rsquo;s
hands were gripped on the back of a chair, until
his knuckles showed white with the strain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid Henderson, will you&mdash;dare you say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
if you told the truth about this miserable business
you would not be reinstated and allowed to
play?&rdquo; went on the captain relentlessly. &ldquo;If you
told the whole story, couldn&rsquo;t you get back on
the team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell,&rdquo; said Sid slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t want to get back on the
team?&rdquo; fired Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than you know&mdash;more than you know,&rdquo;
was Sid&rsquo;s answer, as he went out of the room.</p>

<h3>A FRESHMAN PLOT</h3>


<p>Tom stood staring at the door which closed
after Sid&mdash;staring as if he could not believe what
he had heard. He was roused from his reverie
by Phil&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve only made matters worse,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made &rsquo;em worse? They can&rsquo;t be any worse,&rdquo;
was the testy reply. &ldquo;Hang it all! We&rsquo;re about
as bad off now as we well can be. I wanted to
get Sid back on the team, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something we can&rsquo;t get at,&rdquo; declared
Phil. &ldquo;It is something pretty strong, or Sid
would never keep quiet and see the college lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless he&rsquo;s altogether different from
what he was last term,&rdquo; agreed Tom, with a puzzled
air. &ldquo;He once said he hoped he would be
able to tell us what his secret was&mdash;soon&mdash;I only
wish the time would come&mdash;soon&mdash;we need Sid&rsquo;s
stick work on the team. I wonder if it has anything
to do with a girl&mdash;Miss Harrison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only one factor in the game. I fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that was what Sid meant when he said he wanted
to get back on the team more than we realized&mdash;he
meant that it was so Miss Harrison would be
friends with him again, for the same thing that
caused the disagreement between them, got Sid
into trouble with the proctor. And, if what Ruth
says is true, Miss Harrison cares a lot for Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t tell much about girls,&rdquo; retorted
Tom, with an air of a youth who was past-master
in the art of knowing the feminine mind. &ldquo;Of
course that&rsquo;s not saying that Ruth doesn&rsquo;t mean
what she says,&rdquo; he added hastily, for Phil was
her brother. &ldquo;But look at how Miss Harrison
went with Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a couple of times, and I fancy she didn&rsquo;t
know his true character. She gave him his quietus
soon enough after the trick he tried to play with
the mirror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Well, I wish this tangle would
be straightened out somehow. It&rsquo;s getting on my
nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A baseball &rsquo;varsity captain shouldn&rsquo;t have
nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I can&rsquo;t help it. Hello, some
one&rsquo;s coming. Maybe it&rsquo;s Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Dutch Housenlager, by his tread,&rdquo;
and Phil&rsquo;s guess was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad I found somebody in,&rdquo; remarked Dutch,
as he was about to throw himself with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
force on the old sofa. Tom grabbed the
catcher, and shunted him off to one side so violently
that Dutch sat down on the floor, with a
jar that shook the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; he demanded, somewhat
dazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was to save our sofa,&rdquo; Tom explained.
&ldquo;You were coming down on it as if you were
making a flying tackle. It would have been
broken like a half-sawed-through goal post if
you had landed. I side-tracked you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Dutch, as he slowly arose.
&ldquo;Next time I wish you&rsquo;d serve notice on me when
you&rsquo;re going to do a thing like that, and I&rsquo;ll
wear my football suit,&rdquo; and he rubbed his back
gingerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind translating your remark
about being glad you found somebody in?&rdquo; requested
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, son. I&rsquo;ve been to about sixteen
different domiciles this evening, and every
one was vacant. I&rsquo;ve got something to talk
about. Where&rsquo;s Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went out a while ago,&rdquo; answered Tom,
uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you fellows aren&rsquo;t as chummy
as you once were,&rdquo; remarked Dutch, taking a
seat in the old armchair, after a questioning look
at Tom, who nodded a permission.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we are,&rdquo; exclaimed Phil quickly.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fierce that Sid&rsquo;s off the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rotten&mdash;simply rotten,&rdquo; agreed Dutch. &ldquo;Just
when we need him most. Why didn&rsquo;t you chaps
keep him in the straight and narrow path that
leads to baseball victories?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried,&rdquo; came quickly from Phil. &ldquo;But
Sid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; interrupted Tom. &ldquo;I
think things will straighten themselves out.&rdquo; In
his heart he did not believe this, but he did not
want Dutch to go away with the idea that there
was a cloud hanging over the &ldquo;inseparables.&rdquo;
That would never do. &ldquo;I have an idea that the
faculty will relent at the last minute,&rdquo; went on
the captain. &ldquo;Especially when they know that
the championship depends on it. Then they&rsquo;ll
let Sid play. If they don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll get up another
petition, and make Bascome and his crowd sign,
or we&rsquo;ll run &rsquo;em out of college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the freshmen brings me to what
I came here for,&rdquo; declared Dutch, and Tom gave
a sigh of relief, that their visitor was away from
the delicate subject. &ldquo;What are we going to do
to fool the first years, and keep &rsquo;em away from
our spring dinner?&rdquo; demanded Dutch. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I called about. The dinner is to be held
next week, a few days before our game with Fairview,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and, naturally, the freshies will try to break
it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so busy with getting ready for the
exams and baseball, that I haven&rsquo;t given the dinner
much thought,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;Of course
we&rsquo;ve got to have it, and we must fool the
freshies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go have a talk
with Holly Cross. He may be able to suggest
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; called Dutch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call on
Holly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the three strolled down the corridor, out
on the campus, and in the direction of Holly&rsquo;s
room, the genial center fielder having an apartment
in one of the college club houses, Dutch
nudged his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;there go Ford Fenton
and Bert Bascome, with several freshies. I don&rsquo;t
like to see one of the sophs mixing it up so close
with the first years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Ford ought to
stick to his own class. The trouble is few of
our fellows like him, on account of his ways and
his &lsquo;uncle,&rsquo; whereas the freshmen will stand for
them. That&rsquo;s why Ford hangs out in their camp.
But with our annual spring dinner coming off, I
don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ford wouldn&rsquo;t dare betray us,&rdquo; was
Phil&rsquo;s opinion. They kept on across the campus,
and were soon in Holly&rsquo;s room, where plans for
the dinner were eagerly discussed.</p>

<p>If they could have seen what took place a
little later in the room of Bert Bascome, the four
sophomores would have had more cause than
ever to regret the intimacy between Ford Fenton
and some of the first-year crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your best chance to get even with them
for making fun of you, Ford,&rdquo; Bascome was urging
the lad whose uncle had once been a coach
at Randall. &ldquo;It will serve them right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hate to give their plans away,&rdquo; objected
Ford. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sophomore, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t treat you as one,&rdquo; urged Henry
Delfield, Bascome&rsquo;s crony. &ldquo;It will be a fine
chance to get back at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose they find out that I told?&rdquo; asked
Ford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They never will. We&rsquo;ll see to that,&rdquo; promised
Bert eagerly. &ldquo;All we want you to do is
to tell us where the dinner is going to be held.
We&rsquo;ll do the rest. There&rsquo;ll be a fight, of course,
when we arrive, to break it up, and, just so Parsons,
Clinton, Henderson and that crowd won&rsquo;t
be suspicious, you can pitch into me&mdash;make believe
knock me down, you know, and all that.
Then they won&rsquo;t have any suspicion of you.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Think not?&rdquo; inquired Ford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not. All we want is a tip, and when
you&rsquo;ve given it you&rsquo;ll be in a position to laugh
at those fellows who are laughing at you so
often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, they do make a lot of fun of
me,&rdquo; said Ford weakly. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll let you
know, as soon as I find out where the dinner&rsquo;s
going to be held. But don&rsquo;t squeal on me,&rdquo; and
the prospective traitor looked apprehensively at
the plotting freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds,&rdquo; Bascome assured him solemnly,
and Ford left, promising to deliver his
classmates into the hands of their traditional
enemies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<h3>THE SOPHOMORE DINNER</h3>


<p>When Phil, Tom and Dutch Housenlager
came from Holly&rsquo;s room that evening, they were
just in time to see Ford Fenton emerge from his
plotting conference with Bascome and his cronies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Ford has
been in with those fellows for some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably trying to think up some scheme so
he can get to be baseball manager next year,&rdquo;
suggested Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;By Jove, I believe I have
it. Come on back to Holly&rsquo;s room for a few minutes,&rdquo;
and he took hold of his chums and fairly
led them away, much to their mystification. There
was another conference, which lasted a long time,
and for a day or two thereafter much activity in
the ranks of the sophomores.</p>

<p>The dinner was to be a &ldquo;swell&rdquo; affair, to quote
Holly Cross. An elaborate menu had been decided
on, and there were to be several &ldquo;stunts&rdquo;
more or less elaborate on the part of the &ldquo;talented&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
members of the class. The affair was to
be held in a hall in Haddonfield, and the great
object of the second-year fellows, of course, was
to prevent the time and place of the dinner becoming
known to their enemies, the freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;ll bite?&rdquo; asked Tom, an
evening or two later, as he, together with Phil
and Sid and Holly, were in the room of the
&ldquo;inseparables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It depends on us,&rdquo; answered Holly, who was
the president of the sophomores. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll
trail along when they see us go out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t have some of their number trail
after the main bunch,&rdquo; spoke Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take our chances; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
came from Sid. &ldquo;Well, are we all ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty nearly,&rdquo; answered Holly. &ldquo;I want to
wait until it&rsquo;s a little darker. Then we&rsquo;ll slip off.
I hope the chap is there with the auto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He promised to be,&rdquo; said Tom, and they sat
about, waiting impatiently for the hour of action
to arrive. It came finally, ticked off by the impatient
little clock, and four figures stole from
the sophomore dormitory, and hurried across the
campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they come,&rdquo; said Tom, in a low voice,
a moment later. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trailing us all right.
See &rsquo;em sneaking along on the other side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; spoke Phil. It was just light enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to discern a number of hazy figures creeping
along a boxwood hedge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See anything of that traitor, Fenton?&rdquo; asked
Holly, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s with the other crowd,&rdquo; answered
Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in fear of his life that we&rsquo;ll find
him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if we hadn&rsquo;t already,&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>Hurrying along, the four lads entered a trolley
that was headed for Haddonfield. They looked
back, as they were on the platform, and saw the
shadowy figures leap into an auto which they
knew belonged to Bert Bascome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; spoke Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll be ready for &rsquo;em,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>A little later Tom and his chums were in the
town and they hurried to a building, containing
several halls or meeting rooms, where the students
frequently held dinners, or gave dances and
other affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of them since we arrived?&rdquo;
asked Holly of Tom as they scurried
into the structure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but they&rsquo;ll be on hand. Ford has tipped
them off all right; the little puppy! Say, what
ought we to do to him? Tar and feathers, or
give him the silence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can settle that later,&rdquo; remarked Phil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
&ldquo;Just now let&rsquo;s see how we make out against the
freshies. It&rsquo;s tough to have to acknowledge that
there&rsquo;s a traitor in the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is. Come on, now I hope everything
is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man came out of a room as the four sophomores
knocked on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All arranged?&rdquo; asked Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now I hope you young gentlemen don&rsquo;t
have too much of a fight. Don&rsquo;t break the furniture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any more than we can help,&rdquo; promised
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the other fellows come&mdash;I mean the
freshmen, let &rsquo;em right up,&rdquo; instructed Holly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready for &rsquo;em. Are the rear stairs
clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can slip out that way, and I put
double locks on the door you&rsquo;ll go out of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a spring lock on the one they&rsquo;ll enter
by?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just as you told me. Now don&rsquo;t do too
much damage,&rdquo; and the man, the proprietor of
the place, seemed somewhat apprehensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll pay for everything,&rdquo; agreed Holly.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re ready any time Bascome and his
crowd are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the sophs didn&rsquo;t think of a game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
like this to play on us when we tried to break up
their dinner last year,&rdquo; observed Sid, as the four
entered the room.</p>

<p>The place presented a curious sight. There
was a table set as if for a banquet, with plates,
knives and forks, glasses, and with the usual
candles burning in silver candelabras. At the
head of the banquet board was a stuffed figure,
representing a Randall college student, with the
college colors in gay ribbons pinned on one side
of his caricature of a face, while the sophomore
hues adorned the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got the camera and flash powder?&rdquo; asked
Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; answered Sid, who, because of
his knowledge in that line, had been selected for
this post of honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here pretty soon now,&rdquo; prophesied
Tom. &ldquo;Bascome has his crowd in waiting
somewhere, and he just lingered around college
until he saw us start. Then they&rsquo;ll delay until
they think we&rsquo;re all here, and they&rsquo;ll rush in, and
make a rough house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, they <i>think</i> they will,&rdquo; corrected Phil,
with a grin. &ldquo;I rather think they&rsquo;ll be surprised
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four moved about the room, completing
their arrangements, while Sid busied himself with
a large camera, which was focused on the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
leading into the banquet hall, and got ready a
flashlight powder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I hear them coming,&rdquo; spoke Tom in
a whisper, about half an hour later. &ldquo;Get ready,
Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They listened. Out in the corridor there were
shuffling noises, as if several persons were trying
to walk quietly. There was a brushing against
the door, and a cautious whisper.</p>

<p>Suddenly the knob of the portal was tried, and
a voice in the hall cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give up, sophs! We&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several bodies flung themselves against the
door, and to the surprise of the freshmen, who
were headed by Bascome and Delfield, they
found that the portal was not locked. It opened
easily&mdash;so easily, in fact, that several of the lads
fell to the floor, and the others rushed over them.
There was a scene of confusion, and this probably
prevented the attacking freshmen from seeing
that only four sophomores were present. The
first year lads caught sight of the table, with its
glistening array of silver and glass, and they
took it for granted that they were in the banquet
place of their enemies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows! We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; yelled
Bascome, scrambling to his feet. &ldquo;Upset things,
and then capture Holly Cross. There he is!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>With a yell his cronies sprang to obey the
sporty freshman. They fairly tumbled over each
other until they filled the room. Then, with a
bang, the door by which they had entered
slammed shut behind them, fastening with a
strong spring lock on the outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready with the camera, Sid!&rdquo; cried Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; answered Sid.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time the freshmen seemed
to realize that only a small number of sophomores
were present&mdash;four, who were ensconced behind
a table, and near an open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to our banquet, freshies!&rdquo; cried
Tom.</p>

<p>Holly Cross caught up the effigy of a sophomore
and tossed it at Bascome. The freshman
leader, taken by surprise, clasped the figure in
his arms, and Phil yelled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em have it, Sid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a blinding flash, and a dull boom,
as the flashlight powder exploded, and it was
followed by a gasp of fear from the freshmen.
Then Holly switched on the electric lights, which
had been turned off, and addressed the huddled
group of freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I hope you enjoy your call,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;As for us, we have to leave you, as we
are already a little late for the banquet. This
is only a sample of what we will have, and as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
sort of memento of this auspicious occasion, let
me inform you that we have a flashlight photograph
of you in your most interesting poses. Bascome,
smile a little, if you please&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;look
pleasant. That will do. You may lay aside
the rag doll now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a strong expression the freshman president
cast aside the effigy, and yelled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, we&rsquo;re stung! But we can prevent
these four from going to the banquet, anyhow!
Get at them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaped across the table, followed by several
of his fellows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late! Sorry to leave you!&rdquo; cried Tom, as
he and his chums glided through the open doorway
behind them, Sid taking the camera with him.</p>

<p>The door was hastily pulled shut, and bolted,
barred and locked, just as the group of infuriated
freshmen threw themselves against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trapped!&rdquo; Tom heard Bascome shout from
the other side of the portal. &ldquo;Try the other
door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s locked, too,&rdquo; came the despairing cry.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re caught!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Phil exultantly. &ldquo;Ta-ta,
freshies! Next time you listen to a traitor, take
care to lay better plans. We&rsquo;re off to our annual
feed. When you get out come along, and we&rsquo;ll
give you the leavings. You can have Fenton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
too,&rdquo; and the four who had successfully turned the
trick on their class enemies, hastened off, leaped
into a waiting auto, and were soon at the banquet
hall, where their fellows were anxiously expecting
them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

<h3>TOM&rsquo;S LAST APPEAL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Did it work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were they surprised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get their picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dozen other questions, besides these, were
asked of Tom and his chums, as they entered
the hall where the real sophomore banquet was
about to take place. Around them eagerly
thronged their classmates, all anxious to know
how the trick had developed, for, it is needless
to say that Ford Fenton&rsquo;s treachery was discovered,
and plans laid to offset it, with what effect
the reader has learned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It worked like a charm,&rdquo; responded Holly
Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think I have a fine picture of them
rushing in, and Bascome hugging the dummy,&rdquo;
added Sid. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll take a flash of this banquet,
and we&rsquo;ll post &rsquo;em all over college, with a
notice saying: &lsquo;Gaze on this picture&mdash;then on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that!&rsquo; It will be great!&rdquo; and he proceeded to
arrange his camera to take a different view of
the banquet scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Fenton?&rdquo; inquired Tom, looking
around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; replied Dutch Housenlager.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nasty scandal to get out about Randall,&rdquo;
commented Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll take care that it doesn&rsquo;t get out,&rdquo;
responded Holly. &ldquo;Ford will keep still, and I&rsquo;ll
make a school-honor matter of it for the others.
Only Fenton had better go back to his friends,&rdquo;
he added significantly.</p>

<p>I presume my readers have already guessed
how the affair came about. Holly and his chums
suspected, after seeing Fenton so chummy with
Bascome and his crowd, that there might be at
least a &ldquo;leak&rdquo; in regard to the time and place of
the sophomore dinner. To forestall any such
event, a ruse was adopted. It was arranged to
hold the real dinner in a seldom-used hall, but to
go ahead with arrangements as if one was going
to take place in the usual building. To give color
to this, Holly, Tom, Sid and Phil pretended to
sneak off, as if to avoid the freshmen, but, in
reality, to lead them on. Bascome and his followers
trailed after, were drawn into the hall
where the &ldquo;fake&rdquo; dinner table was set, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
trapped, as told. They were locked in, and it
was some time before they could summon help
to open the doors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the real banquet came off most successfully.
Later the picture Sid had taken, of
Bascome and the freshmen, rushing pell-mell into
the supposed dining hall, was developed and
printed, while its companion-piece was hung up
with it, showing the triumphant sophomores gathered
at the board, making merry. It made a
great hit, and the freshmen did not hear the last
of their defeat for many moons.</p>

<p>As for Fenton, he was made aware, that very
night, of the fact that his indiscrete conduct, to
give it the mildest term, was common knowledge.
He withdrew from college, fearing the just wrath
of his classmates, but, lest the scandal might
stand against the fair name of Randall, he was
induced to come back. He was promised that
no punishment would be meted out to him, and
none was, in the common acceptance of that term.
But his life was made miserable in more ways
than one.</p>

<p>The spring term was drawing to a close. With
all the excitement attending the annual examinations
there was mingled with it the anxiety about
the baseball team, and Randall&rsquo;s chances for winning
the championship, and the gold loving cup.
The latter was placed on view in one of the Haddonfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
stores, and daily a crowd of persons,
including many students, could be seen in front
of the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;ll get it?&rdquo; asked Tom of Phil,
a few days before the final game with Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you on pitching?&rdquo; asked Phil, for
Tom had done little more than light practice since
his accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I think. My hand is in fair shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity you&rsquo;re not a southpaw, or else it&rsquo;s too
bad you caught that ball,&rdquo; said Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. I can pitch all right, and I would
have felt like leaving the team, if I had let that
liner get past me, hot as it was. No, I&rsquo;m not
worrying from my end, though perhaps I should.
It&rsquo;s our batting I&rsquo;m alarmed about. Hang it all,
if only Sid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use going over that again,&rdquo; and
Phil spoke quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I presume not. Well, we&rsquo;ve just got to
win from Fairview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose it would do any good to tackle Sid
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll try, if I get a chance. I
wish I knew his secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chance came sooner than Tom or Phil
expected it would. It was the evening of the day
before the final game with Fairview. There had
been hard practice in the afternoon, and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Tom found himself in good shape, and noted an
improvement in his fielding forces, the batting
was weak. He was tired, and not a little discouraged.
His one thought was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only get Sid to play, it would
strengthen the whole team. He would stiffen
the rest of &rsquo;em up, and stiffening is all that some
of them need. Oh&mdash;well, what&rsquo;s the use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Phil were alone in the room, discussing
plans for the game the next day, when
Sid entered. One look at his face showed that
he was moody and out of sorts. He had been
off on a tramp, after biology specimens, and with
scarcely a word to his chums he began changing
his field clothes for other garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going out this evening?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Guess not,&rdquo; was the rather short answer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do some studying. What
have you fellows got on the carpet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest,&rdquo; answered Tom, and after supper he
returned to the apartment, and stretched out on
the creaking sofa, while Phil occupied the easy
chair. Sid was at his desk writing, when a knock
came at the door.</p>

<p>The deposed second baseman started, and half
arose. Then he sat down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t some of you going to answer
it?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired to move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; added Phil, but, as he was nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the portal than Sid, he got up, with much groaning,
and opened the door. Wallops stood there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A message for Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; he announced,
and he handed Phil a letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Give it to me!&rdquo; cried Sid, almost
snatching it from Phil&rsquo;s fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just going to, old man,&rdquo; was the gentle
answer, and it seemed as if Sid was afraid his
chum would see the writing on the envelope.</p>

<p>Sid tore open the epistle, read it at a glance,
and tore it up, scattering the fragments in his
waste paper basket. Then he strode over to his
closet, and got out his coat and cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going out?&rdquo; asked Phil, politely interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; muttered Sid.</p>

<p>Tom slowly arose from the old sofa, the
boards on the back and front creaking dismally
with the strain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid,&rdquo; spoke Tom, and there was that in his
voice which made Phil and Sid both look at the
captain. &ldquo;Sid, I&rsquo;m going to make a last appeal
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; almost begged the second baseman,
and he put up his arm, as though to ward
off a blow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Tom, I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; insisted Tom, almost fiercely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood this long enough. It&rsquo;s not fair to
yourself&mdash;not fair to the nine.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; and Sid tried
to speak calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do,&rdquo; and by this time Tom was on
his feet, and had walked over toward the door.
&ldquo;Yes, you do know. You received a note just
now. There&rsquo;s no use in me pretending I don&rsquo;t
know what it is, for I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; went on Tom, &ldquo;that I know what it
portends. I don&rsquo;t know who it&rsquo;s from, and I
don&rsquo;t care; neither do I know what&rsquo;s in it. But
I do know that it calls you out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got to go,&rdquo; murmured Sid, as though
it was a summons from fate, and he could not
avoid it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do nothing of the sort!&rdquo; cried
Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To that gambling hall? To lose your money
again? Haven&rsquo;t you manhood enough to say
&lsquo;no&rsquo;? Can&rsquo;t you stay away? Oh, Sid, why do
you go? Why don&rsquo;t you be fair to yourself&mdash;fair
to the nine? We need you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom held out his hands appealingly. There
was a mist before his eyes, and, he fancied, something
glistened in those of his chum. Phil stood,
a silent spectator of the little scene, and the clock
ticked on relentlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to help us win?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I do!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do it!&rdquo; cried Tom, in ringing tones.
&ldquo;Break off this miserable life! Give up this
gambling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gambling!&rdquo; cried Sid, and he shrank
back, as though Tom had struck him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare you deny that you&rsquo;re going from here
to the gambling den in Dartwell?&rdquo; asked Tom,
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Sid was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare deny it,&rdquo; went on the captain.
&ldquo;Now, Sid, I&rsquo;ve made my last appeal.
From now on I&rsquo;m going to act. I&rsquo;m captain of
the nine, and what I say goes. I say you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
go out to that gambling hall to-night!&rdquo; and, before
either of his chums were aware of his action,
Tom had sprung forward, locked the door, and
taken out the key. &ldquo;There! Let&rsquo;s see you go
out now!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he planted himself in
front of the portal and folded his arms, a picture
of defiance.</p>

<p>Sid acted as if stunned for a moment. Then,
fairly springing forward, he cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand aside, Tom! I&rsquo;ve got to go out now!
You don&rsquo;t understand. Stand aside and let me
pass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not! You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t make a beast of yourself
any longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand aside or I&rsquo;ll tear you away from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
door and burst it open!&rdquo; and Sid fairly hissed
out the words.</p>

<p>Tom never moved. Calmly he faced his chum.
Though his face was stern, there was a look of
deep sorrow on it. As for Phil he knew not what
to do or say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; asked Sid, and his voice was
calmer, &ldquo;will you stand aside, or have I got to
force you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going out of here to-night,&rdquo; repeated
Tom. &ldquo;This has got to end. I&rsquo;m going
to find out your secret&mdash;the secret you are keeping
in spite of your better self. We&rsquo;ll get at the
bottom of this&mdash;we&rsquo;ll restore you to yourself,
Sid&mdash;to the nine that needs you. We&rsquo;ll have the
ban removed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more he held out his hands appealingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask you for the last time, will you stand
back?&rdquo; came from Sid, in steely tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Tom resolutely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo; and Sid approached
closer. He made a grab for Tom&rsquo;s outstretched
right hand, and wrenched it cruelly. In spite of
himself Tom gave a cry of pain, for the injury
was tender yet.</p>

<p>This seemed to break the spell. Phil sprang
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid&mdash;Tom!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What are you
doing?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>They seemed to realize, then, that they had
nearly come to blows. With a sob, almost of
despair, Sid released his hold of Tom&rsquo;s hand, and
staggered back. At the same time the captain,
reaching in his pocket for the key, inserted it in
the door, and shot back the lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; he said gently.</p>

<p>Sid, with never a word, but with a look of
anguish on his face, as if he was torn between
two fates, passed out.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

<h3>THE BAN LIFTED</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I never knew that clock ticked so loud,&rdquo; remarked
Tom, after a silence that seemed interminable.
&ldquo;Listen to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does make an infernal racket,&rdquo; responded
Phil, and his voice sounded strange to him. So
great had been the strain engendered by the dramatic
departure of Sid, that both Tom and Phil
felt the awkwardness of speaking of commonplace
matters after it. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll get a new
ticker,&rdquo; suggested Phil, for want of something
better to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Tom slowly. &ldquo;Old things are
best after all&mdash;even if they don&rsquo;t keep just the
right time. I&rsquo;m attached to that clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow Tom felt that the simile might apply
to Sid, but he did not mention it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your hand&mdash;did he hurt it&mdash;I mean is it
all right?&rdquo; stammered Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Tom, with a glance at it.
&ldquo;Sid gave it a wrench, but I guess it will be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
right to-morrow. I can&rsquo;t understand him, can
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;ve given up trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; begged Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
just got to save Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if he won&rsquo;t let us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must do it in spite of himself. I will
try to think of a way,&rdquo; and Tom threw himself
back on the sofa, and turned his face to the wall.
Phil walked softly across the room, and sat down
in the big chair. Somehow it seemed as if their
chum had gone, never to return. For more than
an hour the two sat there, neither speaking, and
the clock ticked on relentlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Tom at length, with a sigh,
&ldquo;guess I&rsquo;ll turn in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid was in his bed when the two chums awoke
in the morning, though neither Phil nor Tom had
heard him come in. He did not refer to the
happening of the previous night, but after chapel,
which was made particularly solemn by a short
sermon by the doctor on the prodigal son, Sid
drew away from his chums, who started for their
classes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; asked Tom, for Sid and
he had the same studies this morning period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to see Moses,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;Moses&rdquo;
being the students&rsquo; pet name for Dr. Churchill.
&ldquo;Zane caught me again last night. I was out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
after hours without a permit. I&rsquo;m in for it I
guess,&rdquo; and Sid laughed recklessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, old man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom, and then
he stopped. He did not know what to say. Then
he felt it would be better to say nothing, and he
hurried on to the lecture, anxious to have it over
with, and get out on the diamond with his men,
for the final game with Fairview was to come off
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil did not see Sid again until after
the game, and then they felt in no condition to
dwell upon his trouble, for Randall had been
beaten by Fairview.</p>

<p>It was a never-to-be-forgotten battle of the
diamond. It opened well for Randall, for Tom
felt a fierce anger at fate in general, that nerved
him to pitch as he had seldom pitched before.
Then things began to go backward, for his hand
was in no condition to stand the fierce work
necessary. Mr. Leighton saw this, and deciding
to save Tom for the Boxer Hall game, took him
out of the box, and put in Evert. After that
it was all over but the shouting, and Fairview
piled up eleven runs against Randall&rsquo;s five. It
was a miserable and dispirited lot of players that
filed back to Randall that evening, nor could the
sympathy of Ruth and Madge take any of the
sting out of it for Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; remarked Phil, in a consoling
sort of voice. &ldquo;We still have a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mighty slim chance,&rdquo; grumbled Tom. &ldquo;Almost
none at all. Oh, if old Sid had only been
with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use talking about that now,&rdquo; went
on Phil. &ldquo;We simply must devote all our energies
to the Boxer Hall game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use thinking of that unless Fairview loses
to them,&rdquo; came from Tom, gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheer up!&rdquo; urged Phil. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t win
the championship by feeling that way,&rdquo; but his
words did little to dispel the gloom in the heart
of the captain.</p>

<p>For the next few days there was hard practice.
Tom&rsquo;s hand received special attention, and
it was hoped that he could last the entire Boxer
game. The batting improved very much, and the
&rsquo;varsity nine was as much on edge as it was possible
for it to be. Meanwhile there was anxiety
over the outcome of the Fairview-Boxer game.</p>

<p>For some time past the Randall players had
been reckoning percentages. It must be remembered
that the games described in detail in this
volume were not the only ones played by the
rival colleges in the league. There were many
more contests than those set down here, but space
will not permit their description.</p>

<p>Sufficient to say that, reckoning in some forfeited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
contests, and computing the standings on
the basis of games won and lost, it developed that
if Boxer Hall beat Fairview it would make a tie
for first place between Boxer and Randall, and
all would then depend on the final contest between
those two latter teams.</p>

<p>Therefore it was with no small jubilation that
the news was received, a week later, that Boxer
had downed Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for <i>our</i> chance to win!&rdquo; cried Tom,
brightening up a little. &ldquo;All we have to do is
to wallop Boxer, and the loving cup is ours. But
Oh, Phil! if we only had Sid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Have you noticed how queer
he&rsquo;s been acting of late?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the same old story. I&rsquo;m done now.
I made my last appeal. By the way, I didn&rsquo;t
hear what happened the time he was last caught
by Zane. What was the verdict?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been announced yet. Faculty held
a meeting but deferred action. It means expulsion,
of course. Poor old Sid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he brought it on himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Phil sharply.
&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we never will,&rdquo; added Tom bitterly. &ldquo;I
consider that Sid has done as much as any one
to defeat the team if we lose the last game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think that. How&rsquo;s your hand?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! I can last all right. It&rsquo;s the batting
I&rsquo;m worried about. Langridge will do his worst,
and we must look for a fierce game. We&rsquo;ve got
to practice until the gong rings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom worked his men to the limit, with Coach
Leighton to help him. Matters seemed a little
brighter, and in spite of his words Tom had a
forlorn hope that, after all, the faculty might
relent, and allow Sid to play.</p>

<p>But this hope was dashed to the ground the
night before the game. Then Sid came into the
room, despondency showing on his face and in
every motion. He began hauling his things out
of the closet and bureau, and packing them in
his trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, old man?&rdquo; asked Phil in great
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving?&rdquo; burst out Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Expelled. Faculty just had a
meeting on my case, and it&rsquo;s all off. I&rsquo;m done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Are you going to
let it go this far, Sid? Aren&rsquo;t you going to speak&mdash;going
to tell your secret, and exonerate yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Sid simply, and his tone
was so miserable that his chums forebore to question
him further. His trunk was soon packed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and he left the room. Neither Phil nor Tom
felt like talking and went to bed early. Sid did
not return that night, and the two ball players
were out early, for practice on the diamond, in
anticipation of the great and deciding game which
was to take place that afternoon on the Boxer
Hall grounds.</p>

<p>A little before noon, when the team had gone
to the gymnasium for a light dinner, and to
have some last secret instruction from the coach
and Tom, Sid Henderson crossed the college
campus. With him was an individual whom, had
Phil or Tom seen, they would have at once recognized
as the sporty youth who had met Sid the
day of the island picnic. But there was a great
change noticed in the young man. He no longer
wore the &ldquo;loud&rdquo; suit and the brilliant tie; he no
longer smoked a cigarette, and there was a chastened
air about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel a bit nervous about it, Guy?&rdquo;
asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, old man. It&rsquo;s a bitter dose to
swallow, but I need it, I guess. I wish I could
do more for you. Are you sure it isn&rsquo;t too late?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not. The team hasn&rsquo;t gone yet.
There&rsquo;s just a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for all you&rsquo;ve
done for me. No one else would have done as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
much. No one else would have kept his promise
in the face of such odds. It wasn&rsquo;t right for me
to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We agreed not to talk about that, you know,
Guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help mentioning it. Lead on. I&rsquo;ll
explain to Dr. Churchill, and all the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two disappeared into the doctor&rsquo;s residence,
and, presently there might have been seen
wending their way thither the various members
of the Randall college faculty.</p>

<p>What took place occurred behind closed doors,
and what that was, only was known afterward
when Sid made his explanation. Sufficient, for
the present, to say that the meeting was a protracted
one, much to the restlessness of several
of the younger professors who wanted to go to
Boxer Hall to witness the championship struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, are we all agreed?&rdquo; asked Dr.
Churchill, as he smiled kindly on Sid, and regarded
with a pitying glance the youth whom
the second baseman had addressed as Guy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; answered Professor Tines. &ldquo;I
seldom like to reverse myself, but I feel that it is
warranted on this occasion. I will vote to remove
the ban that has been on Mr. Henderson,
and restore him to his full college rights and
privileges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we all feel the same way,&rdquo; spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Professor Bogardus, the science teacher, &ldquo;and I
am glad that I can change my vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we all are,&rdquo; went on Dr. Churchill.
&ldquo;Mr. Henderson, I congratulate you, in the name
of the college, for bearing up as you did, in the
face of heavy odds. You are now a Sophomore
in good standing, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I play on the team?&rdquo; burst out Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; answered the genial old doctor,
his eyes twinkling, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be there to see you
win, at least for the last part of the game. The
ban is removed, Mr. Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, all,&rdquo; spoke Sid feelingly to the
assembled professors. Then, turning to his companion,
he added: &ldquo;Come on, Guy. I&rsquo;m going
to get in the last game, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not come. You&rsquo;ve had enough of
me. I&rsquo;m going back to mother. She&mdash;she needs
me now,&rdquo; and the former sportily-attired lad
turned away.</p>

<p>Sid hurried over to the gymnasium. His heart
was beating in wild exultation. At last he was
eligible to play on the nine! He could help them
to win, for that Randall would lose never entered
his head.</p>

<p>He reached the gymnasium. It seemed
strangely deserted and quiet for a championship
day. Sid felt a sense as if an icy hand was clutching
his heart.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where&rsquo;s the ball nine?&rdquo; he asked one
of the janitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ball nine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid thought the man would never answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the ball nine has gone over an hour,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;They went to Boxer Hall in a big
automobile&mdash;a rubberneck they calls &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone! Over an hour!&rdquo; gasped Sid. &ldquo;Can I
get there in time&mdash;in time to play? I must! I
will! It&rsquo;s my last chance! Oh, I must get
there!&rdquo; and he started on a run for the trolley
line that led to Boxer Hall.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

<h3>A PERILOUS CROSSING</h3>


<p>Sid hurried on, his thoughts in a wild tumult.
In his pocket was a note from Dr. Churchill, restoring
him to all his rights and privileges. Sid
had asked for it, lest Boxer Hall protest his
entrance into the game at the last minute, for Sid
was fully determined to play, and help his team
to win. He knew he was in good form, for he
had not neglected practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can catch the next car,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be in time.&rdquo; Then, as he caught sight of something
yellow through the trees on the banks of
Sunny river, along which the electric line extended,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a car, now! I&rsquo;ll have to sprint for it.
Glad I didn&rsquo;t stop to get my suit. I can borrow
one from a sub when I get there, I guess.&rdquo; He
broke into a run, but noted, curiously, that the
car did not seem to be moving very fast. Then,
as he made the turn in the road, he saw that it
was standing still, and that a number of the passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
were walking about, idly. &ldquo;Must have
had a fuse blow out, or a hot box, and they&rsquo;re
waiting to cool it,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Lucky for me,
as the electrics don&rsquo;t run very often from now
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid dropped into a walk, and was soon at the
stalled car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the second baseman
of the motorman, who was sitting on a
grassy bank, idly chopping at a stone with his
controller handle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For long?&rdquo; asked Sid, his heart thumping
under his ribs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard to say. It&rsquo;s been off nearly an hour
now, and the conductor just telephoned in, and
they said it might be an hour more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An hour more! Then I can&rsquo;t get to Boxer
Hall in time for the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motorman looked quizzically at Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you walk, or hire an auto,&rdquo; he
remarked, and fell again to hammering the stone.
The other passengers were fretting, complaining,
or accepting the situation philosophically, as befitted
their natures. Sid made up his mind
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can walk to Fordham junction, and take the
train,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;From Bendleton, which is
the nearest railroad station to Boxer Hall, it&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
only two miles. Maybe I can run it in time, or
perhaps I&rsquo;ll meet some one who will give me a
lift. Anyway, that&rsquo;s my best chance. I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo;
and, with a final glance at the stalled car, hoping
he might see the flashing up of the lights on it,
which would tell of the power being turned on,
Sid turned and made off toward the distant railroad
station.</p>

<p>As the janitor had informed Sid, Tom and the
other ball players, including the substitutes, had
made an early start in a large automobile, carrying
twenty passengers. It was of the type known
as a &ldquo;rubber-neck,&rdquo; from the fact that they are
used in big cities to take visitors to the scenes of
interest, there to &ldquo;rubber,&rdquo; or stretch their necks
in gazing aloft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See anything of Sid, as you came away?&rdquo;
asked Holly Cross, who sat beside Tom and
Phil, as the auto swayed along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Tom briefly. &ldquo;I fancy he&rsquo;s
left for good. Poor old Sid! Isn&rsquo;t it a shame
that he went to pieces as he did? If we only had
him now our chances would be brighter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you play him if he came along?&rdquo;
asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;provided I could&mdash;that he was in
good standing so Boxer Hall couldn&rsquo;t protest.
But what&rsquo;s the use of talking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in good form, captain?&rdquo; asked Bricktop.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid never goes stale,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;Besides,
with his ability to slice a ball to right or
left field in a pinch, hitting right and left handed
as he does, it would be just great for us to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still worrying?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. So would you, if you were in
my place. Don&rsquo;t you know what this game means
to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we do, me lad,&rdquo; answered Bricktop,
kindly. &ldquo;But say this over to yourself a few
times and you&rsquo;ll feel better. &rsquo;Tis a proverb of
me old Irish ancestors. &lsquo;Soft an&rsquo; aisy goes far
in a day,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s it. &lsquo;Soft and aisy goes far in a
day.&rsquo; Remember that, Tommy, me lad, and take
it &lsquo;aisy&rsquo; as the good Irish say. We&rsquo;ll win&mdash;never
fear&mdash;we&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was talk and laughter, serious conversation
and much chaffing as the auto rumbled along.
They had started early and thought they would
have plenty of time, but something went wrong
with the steering gear once, and a second time
the water in the radiator needed replenishing, so
that with the delays it left the players with no
more than time to get to Boxer Hall in season for
the game, and left hardly any time for practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better hit up the pace a little, my
friend,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Leighton to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, yes, sir,&rdquo; was the answer, and the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
car did make better time, for it was on a good
road. The team fell to laughing and joking
again, but suddenly stopped, as the auto once
more came to a halt just before crossing Pendleton
river, a stream somewhat larger than Sunny
river, and intercepting the main road between the
two colleges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The drawbridge is open,&rdquo; replied the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The players stood up and looked across the
river. The draw, which was necessary on account
of a number of sailboats on the stream,
was swung, making an impassable gap, for the
stream at that point was swift and deep. Some
men were seen on the middle of the bridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Why don&rsquo;t you swing
shut that bridge?&rdquo; yelled Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered one of the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The machinery that operates the draw is
broken. We swung the bridge open to let a boat
pass, and now we can&rsquo;t close it again. We&rsquo;ve
sent for some mechanics to repair it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo; yelled Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not long. Two or three hours, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two or three hours! Great smokestacks!&rdquo;
howled Tom. &ldquo;That will be too late for us. We
can&rsquo;t get to the game on time!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; agreed Holly Cross. &ldquo;And
Boxer Hall will be just mean enough to call a
forfeit, and claim the championship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;ve got to swing this bridge shut, and
let us pass!&rdquo; sung out Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; yelled the men who were on the
bridge, marooned as it were. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried, but
it won&rsquo;t budge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; asked Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; echoed his twin
brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to swim for it,&rdquo; suggested
Dutch Housenlager. &ldquo;That is, unless Grasshopper
Backus can jump over with us on his back,
one at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though they could joke over the situation,
they all knew that it was serious. The time was
drawing close, and they were still some distance
from Boxer Hall. Further inquiry of the men
on the bridge did not help matters, nor did the
fuming and fretting of Tom and his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you suggest a plan?&rdquo; asked Mr. Leighton
of the chauffeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s another bridge about five miles
below here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too far. Ten miles out of our way.
Time we went there, and got back it would be
too late. Boxer Hall would claim the game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Can nothing be done?&rdquo; and the coach looked at
the swiftly swirling river. At that moment a
man driving a mule hitched to a buckboard came
along. He took in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuck, eh?&rdquo; he remarked sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; replied Bricktop Molloy.
&ldquo;Maybe ye happen t&rsquo; be a fairy, Mr. Man, an&rsquo;
can help us across.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try the ford?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ford? We didn&rsquo;t know there was one,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure there is. About half a mile below here.
It&rsquo;s where the river is shallow, and many&rsquo;s the
time I&rsquo;ve driven across before this bridge was
built. The water&rsquo;s a leetle high now, but I guess
your ark could make it. Will it go in water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not too deep, and there&rsquo;s good bottom,&rdquo;
was the chauffeur&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s good bottom, but, as I say, it&rsquo;s a
trifle deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try it, anyhow,&rdquo; suggested Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our
only chance. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the sentiment of all, and the players
getting into their seats again, which they had left
to gaze at the river, the auto was backed up, and
headed for the ford, the man with the buckboard
going in advance to show the way.</p>

<p>As he had said, the water was rather high, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
it seemed to swirl along dangerously fast. He
would not venture in with his mule, but, after a
look at it the chauffeur said he would try it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;if the water
doesn&rsquo;t come up high enough to short-circuit the
batteries or the magneto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>Backing up, to get a good start down the slope
that led to the ford, the chauffeur turned on full
speed. Into the river went the big auto, with its
heavy load. The water splashed up in a spray
as the front wheels, with the big tires, struck the
limpid surface. A moment later the entire machine
was in the water, submerged to the hubs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right! Go on! Go on!&rdquo; urged the
man with the mule. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much deeper
than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is we&rsquo;re done for,&rdquo; remarked the chauffeur
in a low voice.</p>

<p>It was a perilous passage, but the Randall nine
was too anxious over the consequences of delay
to mind that much. The man in charge of the
auto was rather white-faced, but he gripped the
steering wheel, and kept on high speed, though
he throttled down the engine a trifle as he neared
the middle of the river. The big machine careened
dangerously, and several clung instinctively
to the sides.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Leighton anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the chauffeur, as he
peered at a bit of smooth water directly ahead.
It looked to be deep, and he was contemplating
turning to one side, though their guide had warned
him to steer straight for the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on! Keep on!&rdquo; cried the man with the
mule encouragingly. &ldquo;Straight ahead, and you&rsquo;ll
be safe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chauffeur yanked the gasolene lever over
the rachet, opening the throttle wider, and the
car shot forward at increased speed. It swayed,
and seemed about to topple over, righted itself,
almost like a thing alive, and then, with a crunching
of gravel, was out of the stream, and climbing
the slope that led from the ford to the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re over that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Speed her
up now, and get us to Boxer Hall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later the players were on the
diamond, being received by a crowd of their
friends who had preceded them to the game
earlier in the day, for the last game of the season
was a gala affair, and the Randall lads usually
came over to Boxer Hall early in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a battle to the death,&rdquo; said Tom
grimly, as he led his men out to practice.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

<h3>THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME</h3>


<p>From grand stands and bleachers came cheers,
yells, songs and cries of many kinds. There was
a record-breaking crowd, every seat seeming to
be filled when the two nines, in their natty uniforms,
began their warming-up work. In the
bleachers were many townspeople, both Randall
and Boxer Hall adherents. It seemed as if the
unprotected seats, shimmering in the hot sun,
were composed of mats of straw hats, with colored
bands for ornaments.</p>

<p>In the grand stands there was a conglomeration
of many colors, formed by the hats of girls,
and the gay banners they carried, the yellow and
maroon of Randall mingling with the red and
green of Boxer Hall, a combination lately
adopted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great crowd,&rdquo; commented Phil to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But say, look at Langridge send &rsquo;em
in!&rdquo; for the rival pitcher was warming-up with
Stoddard, his catcher.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth and Madge are here,&rdquo; went on Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they? I wonder if Miss Harrison will
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess so. S&rsquo;pose Sid will be on hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. But come on, let&rsquo;s have a talk
with Leighton and Kerr. They may want to say
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The practice went on, the usual conferences
took place between captain and captain, manager
and manager. Boxer Hall, as the home team,
had the privilege of batting last. Batting orders
were submitted for inspection, and the umpire
took several new balls from his valise, and
stripped from them the foil covering. With the
exception of Pete Backus in place of Sid, the
Randall team was the same that had played the
&rsquo;varsity games all season, though the batting order
was different, Holly Cross leading off, he
having improved greatly in stick work. There
was no change in the Boxer team, from when she
had last played Tom&rsquo;s men.</p>

<p>The gong rang sharply. The buzzing talk and
laughter on the grand stands ceased, as the umpire
announced the batteries. There was a moment
of consultation among the two nines, and
then Stoddard, who was Boxer&rsquo;s captain that year,
motioned to his players to take the field. He
donned his mask and protector, and adjusted his
big glove. Langridge, with a cynical smile on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
his face, walked to the pitcher&rsquo;s box. He threw
four preliminary balls to Stoddard, who then
signified that he was ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire, and Holly Cross
stepped up to the plate.</p>

<p>Langridge &ldquo;wound up&rdquo; and sent in a swift one.
Holly did not offer to strike at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike wan!&rdquo; howled the umpire, who was a
bit Irish, throwing one arm up in the air. There
was an indrawing of breath on the part of the
Randall players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a mile outside,&rdquo; complained Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>Holly struck at the next one, and missed. The
following was a foul, and this gave his friends
some encouragement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lambaste the next one!&rdquo; yelled Bean Perkins
from amid his throng of singers and shouters.
But Holly struck out. Nor did any better luck
attend Dan Woodhouse, who fanned. There was
a wicked look in the eyes of Bricktop, as he
walked to the plate, and perhaps for that reason
Langridge walked him. He seemed to know he
would have &ldquo;easy fruit&rdquo; in Pete Backus, who
was taking Sid&rsquo;s place, and he did, for he easily
struck him out, and Bricktop died on second,
which he had stolen. No runs for Randall that
inning.</p>

<p>It was not without a nervous tremor that Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
walked to the box, to see what he could do against
Boxer. He wondered how his hand was going
to stand the strain, though it seemed to have
healed perfectly.</p>

<p>After exchanging the regulation number of
practice balls with Dutch Housenlager, Tom was
ready for Ralling, who was first up at the bat
for Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>Dutch signalled for a puzzling drop, and Tom
delivered it, but Ralling took a quick step forward,
and, before the curve &ldquo;broke&rdquo; he got his bat on
it, and sent a pretty single just over Bricktop&rsquo;s
head, though the plucky shortstop leaped high to
get it. Ralling was safe on first.</p>

<p>McGherity fanned twice, but the third time he,
too, found the ball, and rapped out a two bagger,
bringing in Ralling, who had managed to steal
to second, though Tom tried desperately to throw
him out. Roy Conklin was up next, and
struck out, and then came Arthur Flood&rsquo;s turn.
How it happened Tom couldn&rsquo;t tell, but the ball
twisted in his hands, and instead of an out curve
it went over the plate straight, and at slow speed.</p>

<p>Flood hit it a mighty &ldquo;poke&rdquo; and away the
horsehide spheroid sailed, well over the head of
Holly Cross in center field. But Holly pluckily
raced after it, and, though McGherity came in with
a run, Flood found it expedient to linger on
third. By this time all Boxer Hall was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
frenzy of delight, for they were two runs to the
good, and only one out. But there were two, a
moment later, for Flood, taking chances, was
caught napping on the third bag, and put out by
a quick throw. George Stoddard fanned, and that
ended the inning, with the score 2 to 0, in favor
of Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>Randall could not score in the next inning
though Tom knocked a two bagger. He stole
third, and then had to stay there and watch the
Jackson twins and Dutch Housenlager ingloriously
fan the air. It was bitterness as of gall and
wormwood, but Tom tried not to show it, as he
took his place in the box for the ending of the
second inning.</p>

<p>Things looked a little brighter when Pinkey
Davenport laid down a little bingle, almost in
front of Tom, who tossed it to Phil, on first, and
there was one down, with scarcely an effort. Then
Langridge sent a neat little fly to Pete, on second
base, and Bert Hutchin fanned, making
three out in such quick succession that the wild
cheering of Boxer Hall was checked, and Bean
Perkins and his cohorts had a chance to let loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Randall, do &rsquo;em up! Wallop &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
shouted a tall dignified man, accompanied by
two pretty girls who sat well down in front on
the center grand stand. &ldquo;Eat &rsquo;em alive! Eat
&rsquo;em alive!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; cried one pretty girl, clasping his
left arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; exclaimed the other pretty girl,
seizing his right arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my dears,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I want to see my old college
win? And they will, too! Those boys have
grit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re short one of their best players,&rdquo;
said a man next to the &ldquo;old grad,&rdquo; and he
told about Sid, for that was common knowledge
now.</p>

<p>A goose egg went up in the Boxer frame that
inning, and Tom looked happier. But, try as his
men did in their share of the third, nothing resulted,
though Woodhouse laid out a pretty liner,
which was caught, after a run, by Sam Burton.
Then came the heart-breaking last of the third,
when three runs were added to Boxer&rsquo;s score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on back home!&rdquo; yelled some Boxer enthusiast
at the Randall team. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t play
ball! Go back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until we have your scalps!&rdquo; declared
Bean Perkins vindictively.</p>

<p>Seated together on the middle grand stand,
Madge Tyler, Mabel Harrison and Ruth Clinton
looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks pretty bad, doesn&rsquo;t it, Ruth?&rdquo; asked
Madge.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Ruth in a low voice, as she
saw her brother&rsquo;s team coming in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
just <i>praying</i> for them, Madge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ray of light came to Randall in this inning
for, though Pete Backus struck out, Tom laid
down a pretty two bagger and came home on what
was intended as a sacrifice hit by Joe Jackson,
only it was fumbled and Joe got to first. Then
Jerry fanned and Dutch got out on an almost impossible
foul that Stoddard grabbed, banging up
against the grand stand to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One to five,&rdquo; remarked Tom musingly, as he
went to his box, for the ending of the fourth.
&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t be whitewashed, anyhow, but I
guess it&rsquo;s all up with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed so, for in that inning Boxer added
two runs to her credit, even if again Tom did
strike out Langridge. The score was 7 to 1
against Randall now. In the fifth inning Tom&rsquo;s
side gathered in one run, Phil making it on a
sacrifice by Holly Cross, and Boxer further
sweetened her score by another tally. In the
beginning of the sixth Randall had the joy of
seeing another single mark go up in her frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got three runs,&rdquo; Tom remarked to
Phil, as he went to his box. &ldquo;One more in each
inning will look pretty, but it will hardly do the
work,&rdquo; and he spoke bitterly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard luck, old man, but maybe it will turn,&rdquo;
came from Phil.</p>

<p>But, alas for hopes! Many things happened
in the last half of the sixth, and when they were
done occurring there were four runs chalked up
for Boxer. Tom rather lost control of himself,
and had walked two men, while there was ragged
field work to account for the rest of the disaster.
And now the score stood 12 to 3 in favor of
Boxer Hall. It seemed like a farce, and even
Boxer Hall was tired of cheering herself. Tom
saw the championship slipping away after all his
hard work. Even Bricktop Molloy, usually
cheerful in the face of heavy odds, did not smile,
and Mr. Leighton looked gloomy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let the slaughter go on,&rdquo; remarked
Tom, as he came in with his men, to see what
the seventh inning held in store for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d better let Evert pitch the rest
of the game, Mr. Leighton,&rdquo; said Tom, as he
sat down on the bench beside the coach. &ldquo;He
can&rsquo;t do any worse than I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Things may take a turn even yet,
though I admit they look rather bad for us. I
hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Leighton did not finish. There
seemed to be some dispute with the man on guard
at the players&rsquo; gate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; said the official. &ldquo;How
do I know you are a member of the Randall
team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I am!&rdquo; cried a voice, and, at
the sound of it, Tom looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid Henderson!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom! Tom!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;Am I in
time?&rdquo; and he pushed past the gate tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In time? Yes, to see us walloped,&rdquo; answered
the captain bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In time? What do you mean?&rdquo; and Mr.
Leighton caught at a strange note in Sid&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To play the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play the game?&rdquo; Tom had leaped to his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s all right. Here&rsquo;s a note from Dr.
Churchill. The ban is removed. I can play&mdash;I
can play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom ran over, and threw his arms around Sid.
The game came to a sudden stop. The note was
examined. Mr. Leighton told the umpire to
make the announcement that Sid Henderson
would bat for Pete Backus that inning, and take
his place in the game after that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I protest!&rdquo; cried Langridge, coming up with
an ugly look on his face.</p>

<p>There was a conference of the officials, but
in the end they had to admit that Sid was eligible,
and the game started again. But with what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
different feeling among the Randall players! It
was as if new life had been infused into them.
Bean Perkins started the song, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Going to
Wallop &rsquo;em Now!&rdquo; and it was roared out from
several hundred lusty throats.</p>

<p>Nor was it unjustified; for with a grim viciousness,
after Holly Cross had struck out, Dan
Woodhouse rapped out a three bagger the moment
he came up to the bat, and Bricktop followed
with a two-sack ball, bringing in Kindlings,
while Sid, with a happy look on his face, looked
grimly at Langridge, as if telling him to do his
worst. The stands were still trembling under the
stamping that had followed Dan&rsquo;s arrival home
with a run, and when Sid swung at the ball, and
duplicated Dan&rsquo;s trick, bringing in Bricktop, there
was a wild riot of yells. They were kept up even
when Tom sacrificed to bring Sid home, and then
Joe Jackson got to first on a fly that McGherity
muffed. Jerry, by hitting out a pretty liner, enabled
his brother to get to third, while Jerry was
held on first. Up came Dutch and he clouted the
ball to such good purpose that he got to third,
and the Jersey twins scored. Then poor Dutch
died on third for Phil fanned out. But nothing
could dampen the enthusiasm of the Randallites
then, for they had secured five runs, and the
score stood only 12 to 8 against them now.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can catch up!&rdquo; yelled Bean Perkins.
&ldquo;Now for the &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song, fellows,&rdquo;
and the strangely beautiful and solemn strains of
the Latin melody floated over the field.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s men began to play like fiends. They
seemed to be all over the field, and, though Tom
was hit for a single, not another man got to
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we can only hold &rsquo;em down, and bring
in a few more runs we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; panted Tom,
as he came to the bench in the beginning of the
eighth, and sat down beside Sid. &ldquo;But say, old
man, how did it happen that the doctor let you
play at the last minute?&rdquo; he asked, while the
others waited for Sid&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later,&rdquo; the second baseman promised.
&ldquo;Gee, but I had a time getting here! Trolley
wasn&rsquo;t running, and I had to come by train.
Thought I&rsquo;d have a long walk, but I met a fellow
in an auto and he gave me a lift. Then, just as
I got here I heard that the trolleys started running
about five minutes after I left the stalled
car. But, Tom, are we going to win?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure are,&rdquo; declared the captain, clapping
Sid on the back.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

<h3>BATTING TO WIN</h3>


<p>But, though things had started off with a rush
in the seventh, they went slower for Randall in
the eighth, and one run was all that could be
gathered in. Holly Cross got to first, and managed
to steal second and third, while Kindlings
Woodhouse and Bricktop ingloriously fanned.
Sid laid out a beautiful three-bagger, bringing in
Holly with the run. Then Tom was walked,
much to his surprise, with Sid on third, and Joe
Jackson got a pass, thus filling the bases. Randall
was wild, for it looked as if a big play would be
pulled off, but Jerry Jackson fanned, and the
three men expired on the bags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em down, fellows! Hold &rsquo;em down!&rdquo;
pleaded Tom. &ldquo;We only need four runs to win
the game, if we can keep &rsquo;em from scoring in
their next two whacks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; remarked Phil cynically. &ldquo;Ever see a
white black-bird, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; declared Sid savagely.</p>

<p>Tom did manage to retire Boxer without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
run, surpassing himself by the excellence of his
curves. He was more like himself now.</p>

<p>Then came the memorable ninth inning, which,
when Dutch started it off by fanning out, looked
as if the end had come. It looked even more so
when Phil Clinton also whacked only the air and
there was a curious hush over the big crowd as
Holly Cross walked to the plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Holly!&rdquo; yelled Bean. &ldquo;Another like
you gave us before. There&rsquo;s only two out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It looked rather hopeless, with two out, but
Holly slammed out a single bagger. Dan Woodhouse
followed, and hit well, Holly getting
to third in the confusion. Then came Bricktop,
his red hair all awry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Cæsar hit it on the nose, old
man!&rdquo; pleaded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it for your sake, me lad,&rdquo; answered
Bricktop calmly, and he proceeded to swing on
the ball. He knocked a hot little liner to Langridge,
and there was a groan as the pitcher, seemingly,
caught it, but it bounded out of his hands,
rolled between his legs and when he had picked
it up Bricktop was at first, where he was called
safe, though the Boxer players protested it. Holly
had started for home, but when he saw Langridge
stop the ball he ran back, and it was well he did
so, for he was now safe there, as was Dan Woodhouse
on second.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The bases were full, there were two out, and
it needed four runs to win the game when Sid
Henderson came up to the bat. He was as cool
as if he was the first man up in a small game,
and not one on whom a championship depended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid, old man, bat! bat! bat!&rdquo; pleaded
Tom in a low voice. &ldquo;<a href="#image04">Bat to win! It all depends
on you, now!</a>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">

    title="&ldquo;BAT TO WIN! IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU!&rdquo;" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;<a href="#Page_297">BAT TO WIN! IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU!</a>&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Sid did not reply. He was watching Langridge
narrowly, for he knew that pitcher&rsquo;s tricks
of old. Sid did not strike at the first ball, for it
was away to one side, but the umpire called a
strike on him and there was a howl of protest.
It was quickly hushed. Langridge &ldquo;wound up&rdquo;
again, and sent in a swift one.</p>

<p>With an intaking of his breath Sid swung at
it. Almost before he connected his bat with the
horsehide he was aware that he would make a
good strike. There was a sweetness to the resonant
vibration of the stick, as he cast it from him,
and sprinted for first. He could not see where
the ball had gone, though he had had a momentary
glimpse of it going over center field, but he
trusted to Tom, who was in the coaching box at
first, urging him on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty hit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a soaker!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run! Run! Leg it, you old sock doger!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
yelled the man with the two pretty daughters, as
he recklessly swung his silk hat in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A home run! A home run!&rdquo; cried Phil, capering
about, and hugging the Jersey twins, one
in each arm.</p>

<p>Upward and outward sped the ball, away, far
away over the center fielder&rsquo;s head. He ran back
for it, became confused and began wildly searching
around in the deep grass of far outfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on in! Come on in, everybody!&rdquo; Tom
was yelling, and swinging his arms like the sails
of an old windmill.</p>

<p>Holly raced over home plate, followed by
Kindlings. Bricktop was racing in from third,
followed by Sid, who had made such a magnificent
hit. Bricktop tallied the tying run, and Sid
was now running up from third, running as he
had never run before, for he felt that it all depended
on him now. The fielder had the ball
by this time, and had thrown it to the second
baseman, who swung about and relayed it home,
but it was just a second too late, and Sid crossed
the rubber on a grand slide. Four runs in succession!
Oh, how the Randallites did yell! How
they howled! How they stamped until the grand
stands trembled, while as for the members of the
team they fairly smothered Sid!</p>

<p>But the game was not over yet. Tom Parsons
was up next, and, though as nervous as a girl, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
managed to make a single off Langridge, much
to the latter&rsquo;s disgust, for he was being hooted
and howled at almost to the limit. Then Joe
Jackson was struck out, and that ended Randall&rsquo;s
chances. But the score was 13 to 12 in her favor,
and if they could retire Boxer Hall without a
run, the championship was theirs.</p>

<p>Tom did it. How, is Randall history now, and
any &ldquo;old grad&rdquo; will gladly relate it to you. How
two men were struck out in almost less time than
it takes to tell it, and how Tom caught an almost
impossible fly by leaping high in the air as it was
sailing over his head, and downed his third man.
And that was the end. Randall had won the
championship.</p>

<p>Oh, what a scene there was on the diamond
then! Of course, Boxer cheered her rival, and
then, hardly waiting for the answering compliment
from Tom&rsquo;s men, they filed to their dressing
rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid, it was great! Great!&rdquo; cried Tom,
hugging his chum. &ldquo;Simply great, old man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up with him!&rdquo; commanded Phil, and Sid was
hoisted to the shoulders of his fellows, and carted
around, much to his embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bully game! Whoop-de-doodle-de!&rdquo; cried
the man with the pretty daughters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; they cried protestingly, blushing
at the notice attracted to them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t my old
college win? Wow! Wow! Wow!&rdquo; and he
began to dance, while his daughters blushed more
deeply. But who cared?</p>

<p>The diamond was overrun with spectators, anxious
to shake hands with the victorious players,
especially with Sid, who had batted the way to
victory.</p>

<p>Three pretty girls made their way through the
press.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are congratulations in order?&rdquo; asked one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Miss Tyler,&rdquo; answered Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; added Tom, clasping the hands Ruth
Clinton held out to him. Sid stepped to one side,
as Mabel Harrison came up. He was rather
pale under his tan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s all go off and have some
cream,&rdquo; proposed Phil. &ldquo;Come along, Sid, you
and Miss Harrison&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused in confusion, for he had, for the
moment, forgotten the cloud between the two.
Mabel Harrison blushed, and was about to turn
away, but Sid stepped forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will only be too happy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if Miss
Harrison will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered
in confusion. The six were somewhat by themselves
now, for the crowd had surged away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
a joyous look on his face. &ldquo;I can, and I&rsquo;m going,
to explain everything, now. You needn&rsquo;t hesitate
about coming with me, Miss Harrison. See
this,&rdquo; and he held out a duplicate of the newspaper
clipping that had been fraught with such
results. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you fellows thought I
was going the pace,&rdquo; continued Sid, &ldquo;nor do I
blame you, Miss Harrison, for not believing in
me. This is the first chance I&rsquo;ve had to explain.
I was in that gambling raid told of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were?&rdquo; and the girl recoiled a pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Sid, with a little smile, &ldquo;I went
there to rescue my cousin. His name is Guy
Norton, and he is the same flashily-dressed young
man you saw me with at the picnic. Guy&rsquo;s father
died a short time ago, leaving him a fortune,
which he proceeded to get rid of as quickly as
possible. He took to gambling, and fast company,
though his widowed mother never knew
it. She supposed him attending to business in
Dartwell, but, instead, Guy was dissipating. His
sister, Clara, knew of it, however, and wrote to
me to try to save her brother. She came to Dartwell
to help look after him, and boarded with
him. I had considerable control over Guy, for
we used to be little chaps together, and I once
saved him from drowning, so he would generally
do as I said. So I promised his sister I would
save him, and gave my word not to tell anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
about it, as she wanted to keep all knowledge
from her mother, who had a weak heart, and
who, she knew, would die if she ever knew her
son was a gambler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My first service was to take Guy out of a
gambling hall, his sister having written me a
hasty note to the effect that he had gone there
with a large sum of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That piece of paper, with the word &lsquo;trouble&rsquo;
on it must have been from her note,&rdquo; remarked
Phil. &ldquo;We picked it up in the room, after you
went out so quickly that rainy night, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented the victorious second baseman,
&ldquo;Guy was in trouble, sure enough. I went to
Dartwell, and managed to get my cousin to leave
the place, just before the raid. As we went out,
however, the police came in, and Guy and I were
caught. He fought the officers, and called out my
name, in asking me to help rescue him. Instead
I advised him to submit. He was taken away, but
I easily proved that I had nothing to do with the
gambling, and I was allowed to go. I went to
Guy&rsquo;s boarding place, and, from his sister, got
money enough to pay his fine, together with some
I had. In some way my name got in the papers.
Guy might have recklessly given it instead of his
own, thinking to keep the knowledge from his
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cousin was released the next morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
but he made me promise never to tell of his
scrape. That was what sealed my lips. He
promised to reform, if I kept silent, and I did,
though it was hard&mdash;terribly hard,&rdquo; and Sid
looked at Miss Harrison, in whose blue eyes there
were traces of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I knew Guy&rsquo;s mother had a weak heart,
and that the least shock might be fatal, I
dared not even ask her advice. Clara and I decided
to fight it out alone. She arranged to send
me word by a messenger, whenever her brother
went off with his gay companions, and I promised
to go and bring him away, no matter what the
hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did go, many times, to your wonderment,
Tom and Phil, and once I had to cancel a promise
I made to take Miss Harrison to an affair. But
I could not break my word. On one occasion
Guy, who was not himself, recklessly came to the
college seeking me. He had a bottle of liquor
with him, and I took it away from him, hurrying
him back to Dartwell. But Mr. Zane caught me,
and, as I was on my honor to Guy and his sister
to keep silent, I could not explain. I took my
punishment, being barred from the team, and kept
still, though it was hard&mdash;very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were a hero!&rdquo; exclaimed Mabel Harrison,
her blue eyes bright with admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, hardly that, I guess,&rdquo; answered Sid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
but he smiled gratefully. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;so it went on. I dared not tell, for I had given
my word, though I was sorely tempted that day
he came for me at the picnic, and nearly disgraced
me. But Guy would not release me, and
his sister pleaded for just a little longer try at
saving him, and I consented. I paid his gambling
debts many times, and, often, it left me temporarily
without money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things looked very black, Guy would not heed
my requests to stop gambling, and I did not care
what happened. I even went to Bascome&rsquo;s dinner,
thinking to get away from my troubles.
Then, when everything seemed to go by the board,
and I had been expelled for being caught out
late, when I had gone one night to get Guy away
from reckless companions, he suddenly reformed.
He met some girl, I believe, who had a hand in
it. At any rate he turned over a new leaf, gave
up his gambling, and, what relieved me, confessed
everything to his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was much affected, but she forgave him,
and is to take him abroad this week, to straighten
him out. That was the end of my thralldom.
To-day Guy went with me to Dr. Churchill,
made a clean breast of it, told what I had done,
and why, and before the assembled members of
the faculty, proved my innocence. It was just in
time to allow the lifting of the expulsion ban, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
permit me to play&mdash;only I had a task to get here
in time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did, old man!&rdquo; cried Tom, seizing
his chum&rsquo;s hand&mdash;only one, however, for, somehow
Mabel Harrison had the other. &ldquo;You were
in time to help us bat to win! Sid, can you forgive
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive? There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive,&rdquo; declared
Sid, and his eyes were moist. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
blame you in the least for thinking I was doing
the very things I was trying to save my cousin
from. Many a time I went broke on his account,
but I didn&rsquo;t mind, for he was worth saving, for
the sake of his mother and sister, if not for himself.
He&rsquo;s all right now, I believe, and thoroughly
ashamed of himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you,&rdquo; put in Madge Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think you were perfectly splendid, Mr.
Henderson!&rdquo; cried Ruth Clinton, with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>Mabel Harrison did not say what she thought,
but the look from her blue eyes was enough for
Sid. He held her hand, and&mdash;Oh, well, what&rsquo;s
the use of telling on a chap, anyhow? You&rsquo;d have
done the same, I guess, if you had been there.</p>

<p>There was a little pause after Sid had finished
his story, and all about sounded the victorious
yells and songs of the exulting Randallites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, are you ready for those plates of cream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
now?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;Talking is dry work. So
that was your secret, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was it, and hard enough it was to keep,
too, at times, let me tell you,&rdquo; and the second
baseman sighed.</p>

<p>A little later a jolly party sat in an ice-cream
parlor, and their merry laughter and jests brought
smiles to more than one countenance, as the other
guests looked on and listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose Mr. Langridge sent
that false clipping from the newspaper to you&mdash;I
mean the one about Sid?&rdquo; asked Ruth of Mabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; answered the
blue-eyed girl, but I suspect that she did know,
but did not want to say, for she was done with
Langridge forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for college, and a procession in honor
of our victory, the loving cup, and Sid Henderson&mdash;with
bonfires and feasting on the side,&rdquo; remarked
Captain Tom, a little later, when reluctant
good-bys had been said to the girls. And
the celebration in Randall that night was marked
for years afterward in prominent letters in the
college annals. Dr. Churchill made a thrilling
speech, and even Professor Tines condescended
to smile. The loving cup was carried at the head
of a triumphant procession, the light from many
gala-fires glinting from its polished surface.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; remarked Tom, several
hours later when he, Phil and Sid were together
in their room. &ldquo;My, but it has been a baseball
season, though!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great one,&rdquo; commented Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
a corking good team. I only hope we have as
good a one when it comes time to kick the pigskin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess we will,&rdquo; spoke Sid slowly. They
did, as will be related in the next volume of this
series, to be called &ldquo;The Winning Touchdown,&rdquo;
a tale of college football in which we shall meet
all our old friends again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Sid, after a pause, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you fellows are going to do, but I&rsquo;m
going to turn in. I&rsquo;m dead tired after my long
tramp,&rdquo; and he began to get ready for bed, while
Tom and Phil, sitting by the open windows, listened
to the shouts of the revelers out on the
campus, for many had not yet had enough of the
joys of victory. Then, as the captain threw himself
on the old couch, and Phil curled up in the
easy chair, the fussy alarm clock went off with a
whirr, the bell jangling discordantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time to get up, Sid, instead of going to bed,&rdquo;
remarked Phil with a laugh, as he silenced the
racket, and then the three chums&mdash;the inseparables&mdash;stood
and looked at each other, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
clock resumed its interrupted ticking, and the
shouts of the celebrators came in faintly on the
night wind.</p>

<p>Edmond About&rsquo;s classic
masterpiece of whimsical
humor, romantic action
and wild surroundings,
appeals to all classes
and ages of readers. The
lawless, happy-go-lucky
bands of the Grecian
mountains, bargaining
with prisoners and government
officials in a kind of uncivilized traffic,
affords the uncertainty in adventure which
makes delightful reading for boy or man.</p>

<p>Hadji Stavros is the never-to-be-forgotten representative
of the right to get without limits.
To him the only injustice or error in life was in
being weak, in which any unselfishness was
weakness. And yet, he allowed his love for his
daughter to overthrow his system of life. To be
entertained by &ldquo;The King of the Mountains&rdquo;
as a dramatic story is not enough, it is a profound
study of character and life.</p>
